### Instrument Overview [¶](#Instrument-Overview-)

The Imaging Science Substyem (ISS) is used for multispectral imaging of
Saturn, Titan, rings, and the icy satellites to observe their
properties.

### Technical Details [¶](#Technical-Details-)

The ISS consists of two framing cameras. The narrow angle camera
(ISS-NAC) is a reflecting telescope with a field of view of 0.35
degrees. The wide angle camera (ISS-WAC) is a refractor with a field of
view of 0.35 degrees. Each camera is outfitted with a large number of
spectral filters: 23 different filters for the NAC and 17 for the WAC
spanning wavelengths of light from ultraviolet to the near-infrared.
Each camera is a charged coupled device (CCD) detector consisting of a
1024 square array of pixels. The data system allows many options for
data collection, including choices for on-chip summing and data
compression.
