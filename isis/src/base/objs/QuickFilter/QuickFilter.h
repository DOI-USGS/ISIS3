   * @brief Container for boxcar statistics
   *
   * This class is used to compute statisics for NxM boxcars, where N and M are
   * positive odd integers. In general, this object will be loaded by another
   * derived class such as FilterLoader or FilterProcess. The programmer can then
   * use the methods in this class to compute statistics such as the boxcar
   * average, variance, and number of valid pixels in the boxcar.
