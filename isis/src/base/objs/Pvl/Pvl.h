   * @brief Container for cube-like labels
   *
   * This class is used for creating, reading, and writing grouped labels
   * generally from a file. An example of a label is:
   *   @code
   *     Group = Cube
   *       Samples = 512
   *       Lines = 512
   *       Bands = 1
   *     EndGroup
   *   @endcode
   * There are three different groupings, "root", "object", and "group". The
   * information is stored in "keywords". The root grouping can contain objects,
   * groups, and keywords. Object groupings can contain other objects, groups
   * and keywords. Group groupings can only contain keywords. Contents within the
   * group are called keywords which can have integer, double, string values or
   * no value. A keyword with no value is treated as a boolean.
   *
   * If you would like to see Pvl being used in implementation,
   * see class Cube or Preference

   * @internal
   *  @history 2003-01-31 Jeff Anderson - Added Keywords, Keyword, Groups, Group,
   *                                      and CopyGroup methods
   *  @history 2003-03-27 Jeff Anderson - Fixed problem caused by new compiler
   *                                      when attempting to left justify streams.
   *                                      Depricated the ReadInternal and
   *                                      WriteInternali methods. They were
   *                                      replaced by Read and Write methods.
   *  @history 2003-05-16 Stuart Sides - Modified schema from astrogeology...
   *                                     isis.astrogeology...
   *  @history 2003-08-18 Stuart Sides - Modified so labels with repeated objects,
   *                                     groups and keywords could be read in.
   *  @history 2003-09-25 Stuart Sides - Modified "keyword does not exist message"
   *                                     so it has two forms. One which says the
   *                                     keyword was not found at all and the
   *                                     other says the requested occurance was
   *                                     not found.
   *  @history 2003-09-26 Stuart Sides - Modified constructors to take a bool
   *                                     parameter which tells many member
   *                                     functions if they should allow
   *                                     duplacates or not. Also took the
   *                                     allowDuplicates parameter off all of the
   *                                     members who used it.
   *  @history 2003-10-15 Jeff Anderson - Modified write method to place quotes
   *                                      around null parameters (e.g. "")
   *  @history 2003-10-22 Stuart Sides - Added new method Insert.
   *  @history 2003-11-06 Jeff Anderson - Modify UpdateKeyword methods so that
   *                                      they do not throw errors if the keyword
   *                                      does not exist. That is, they simply
   *                                      add a new keyword.
   *  @history 2003-11-06 Jeff Anderson - Modify WriteContainer method to put a
   *                                      space between the value and unit of
   *                                      keywords.
   *  @history 2003-11-06 Jeff Anderson - Added Merge method
   *  @history 2003-12-01 Stuart Sides - Added new occurrence parameter to
   *                                     UseGroup. And added new member
   *                                     GroupOccurrences.
   *  @history 2004-01-22 Jeff Anderson - Fixed iterator out of bounds when
   *                                      parsing for units if the PVL terminated
   *                                      with and EOF instead of the usual END
   *                                      statement
   *  @history 2004-02-10 Jeff Anderson - Added new suite of AddKeyword methods
   *                                      for vectors which take a single unit
   *                                      instead of a vector of units
   *  @history 2004-02-10 Jeff Anderson - Modified parse and write methods to
   *                                      properly handle a single unit on
   *                                      vectors
   *  @history 2004-02-11 Jeff Anderson - Implemented GetUnits method and added
   *                                      AddKeyword method with a NULL value

   *                                      was unwinding the container pointer too
   *                                      far.
   *  @history 2005-02-14 Elizabeth Ribelin - Modified file to support Doxygen
   *                                          documentation
   *  @history 2005-02-23 Elizabeth Ribelin - Fixed unitTest
   *  @history 2005-03-07 Leah Dahmer - Added missing documentation to class.
   *  @history 2006-04-21 Jacob Danton Added format templates abilities.
   *  @history 2006-08-30 Stuart Sides & Brendan George - Added ability to output
   *                                                      in PDS format.

   *           output operator

   *            counting line numbers on error
   *  @history 2010-07-12 Steven Lambright - It's a bad idea to copy
   *            m_internalTemplate in the copy constructor since it describes
   *            whether or not to delete an internal pointer.
   *  @history 2010-09-27 Sharmila Prasad - Validate a Pvl with the Template Pvl
   *  @history 2013-03-11 Steven Lambright and Mathew Eis - Brought method names and member variable
