   * @brief Manages a Buffer over a cube.
   *
   * This class is used to manage a Buffer over a cube. Recall a Buffer is
   * simply a 3-d shape (or subset) of a cube. For example, a line, tile, or
   * spectra are some possible shapes. A buffer manager will walk the shape
   * over the entire cube to ensure every pixel is accessed. When constructing
   * a BufferManager, arguments for the cube size and buffer size are required.
   * For example, construction for a (100 sample, 200 line, 2 band) cube
   * accessed by a line shape would require the shape buffer to have 100
   * samples, 1 line, and 1 band. The manager would then access the lines
   * sequentially in the first band and then proceed to the second band. A 100
   * sample, 1 line, and 2 band shape buffer would access each line but both
   * bands simultaneously. Typically, a BufferManager is not instantiated
   * directly but is used in a derived class such a Line or Tile.
   *
   * If you would like to see BufferManager being used in implementation,
   * see the LineManager, BoxcarManager, or TileManager class.
