   * Sets how the shape is incremented through the cube. By default (if this

   * no overlap. For example, assume a 3 sample by 3 line tile buffer. It would
   * first move across the image from left-to-right starting at sample 1, line 1,
   * and band 1. Upon an increment it would be positioned at sample 4, line 1,
   * and band 1. Each successive increment would cause the sample position to
   * increase by 3 until it exceeds the number of samples in the cube. At that
   * point the shape buffer would be positioned at sample 1, line 4, and band 1
   * (effectively moving to the next row of tiles). The shape would then continue
   * moving across the cube until it reaches the edge again. Then the next row of
   * tiles would be accessed until the shape reached the bottom of the cube. This
   * default management can be overridden using this method. For example, by
   * setting the increments to (6,3,1) we effectively skip every other tile. By
   * setting them to (6,6,1) we skip every other tile and every other row of
   * tiles.  By setting them to (1,1,1) we essentially have NSxNLxNB positions
   * in the cube and the 3x3 tile is managed such that the top left corner
   * of the tile is moved over by 1 sample until it reaches the end of the
   * line then down 1 line and so on until the end of the cube is reached.
