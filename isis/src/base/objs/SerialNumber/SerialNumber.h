   * @brief Serial Number composer
   *
   * A Serial Number is a unique identification for some object such as an
   * Isis cube. A Serial Number for a specific object must be repeatable. This
   * class is intended to be used to create all Serial Numbers for Isis.

   *  @todo This is only a temporary version. The code needs to be modified
   *  to use a PVL file to determine which keywords to use to create the
   *  Serial Number
   *
   *  @history 2005-07-28 Stuart Sides Original version
   *  @history 2005-08-02 Jeff Anderson added new static methods for
   *                      serial number composition from a cube or filename
   *  @history 2006-01-24 Jacob Danton Updated the SerialNumber Compose method
   *                                   to use .trn files specific to the mission
   *  @history 2006-06-15 Kris Becker Added the return of the filename as the
   *                                  fallback default condition.  "Unknown" will
   *                                  still be returned if the input source is a
   *                                  label created in memory and does not have
   *                                  a valid serial number signature and it was
   *                                  not read in from a file.  Add a test for
   *                                  this to the unitTest.
   *  @history 2006-12-08 Stuart Sides Added parameter the the Compose methods
   *                                   to allow or disallow defaulting to the
   *                                   filename. This parameter has a default of
   *                                   false. Which will cause "Unknown" to be
   *                                   returned for files where a SN could not be
   *                                   correctly produced.
   *  @history 2007-07-09 Steven Lambright Changed missions translation filename from Missions.trn to
   *                                   MissionName2DataDir.trn
   *  @history 2007-09-11 Steven Koechle Added three ComposeObservation methods
   *                                   and made code reusable by seperating
   *                                   existing code into two private methods.
   *  @history 2007-09-13 Steven Koechle Fixed boolean paramaters passed into
   *           FindSerialTranslation
   *
   *  @history 2008-01-10 Christpher Austin Removed the use of the system default
   *           file in FindSerialTranslation() and detached ObservationNumber
   *           functionality into its own class
   *  @history 2008-05-09 Steven Lambright Optimized the FindSerialTranslation
   *           method
   *  @history 2008-05-18 Steven Lambright Fixed documentation
   *  @history 2020-03-03 Kristin Berry - Updated to use translation files moved into source.
