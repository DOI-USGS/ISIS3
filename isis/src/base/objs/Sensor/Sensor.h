   * @brief Class for computing sensor ground coordinates
   *
   * The sensor class allows for the computation of parameters related to orbiting instruments.
   * In particular, a time and look direction can be set and from those the ground coordinate
   * (latitude/longitude) along with phase, incidence, and emission angles can be computed.
   * Likewise, a ground point can be set and look direction can be computed. This class is derived
   * from the Spice class.
   *
   * An important capability of this class is the ability to use a surface model other than an
   * ellipsoid when intersecting the look direction of the sensor with the planetary body. This
   * allows for the generation of othrorectified products. The file containing the surface model
   * is a cube and is obtained from the labels in the follow form:
   *   @code
   *     Group = Kernels
   *       ElevationModel = file.cub
   *     EndGroup
   *   @endcode

   *                           lat/lon when appropriate and the radius needed to be converted

   *   @history 2008-06-18 Debbie A. Cook - Made DemRadius radius public instead of private and

   *   @history 2010-09-15 Janet Barrett - Modified the SetLookDirection() method to use a new
   *                           algorithm for finding the intersection of a ray with the DEM. This
   *                           was required to take care of problems that were encountered at the
   *                           poles of global DEM files. The algorithm that is being used was
   *                           taken from "Intersection between spacecraft viewing vectors and
   *                           digital elevation models" by N.A. Teanby.
   *   @history 2010-11-09 Eric Hyer - moved some private members to protected section for Camera
   *   @history 2010-12-07 Steven Lambright - Added LocalRadius(lat,lon) and removed a sqrt
   *                           from SetLookDirection()
   *   @history 2011-01-26 Steven Lambright - The LocalRadius methods now return Distance objects
   *                           and added a LocalRadius() method that uses the Latitude and
   *                           Longitude classes.
   *   @history 2011-02-08 Jeannie Walldren - Added method parameter documentation.
   *   @history 2011-02-09 Steven Lambright & Debbie Cook - Refactored heavily to use Latitude,
   *                           Longitude, SurfacePoint, and iTime where applicable. Optimized
   *                           SetLookDirection. These changes were meant primarily for readability
   *                           and reducing error-proneness of the code.
   *   @history 2011-03-28 Janet Barrett - Fixed the SetLookDirection routine so that it checks to
   *                           make sure that the projection of the DEM is in an Equatorial
   *                           cylindrical projection before using the new ray tracing routine.
   *                           The check for this was moved when other code was added. This was
   *                           causing a problem with footprintinit.
   *   @history 2011-05-03 Jeannie Walldren - Added Isis Disclaimer to files.
   *   @history 2011-05-25 Janet Barrett and Steven Lambright - Moved the ownership of the DEM
   *                           projection to the DEM cube which is owned by CubeManager.
   *   @history 2011-08-22 Steven Lambright - The DEM cube now uses a UniqueIOCachingAlgorithm(5).
   *                           This will probably behave better in all cases. Fixes #364
   *   @history 2011-08-16 Jeff Anderson - Fixed a problem with an infinite loop in the ray tracing
   *                           algorithm.  The problem was first exposed when trying to intersect
   *                           the Vesta DEM on the limb.
   *   @history 2011-12-20 Tracie Sucharski - Added  SpacecraftSurfaceVector method which returns
   *                           the vector between the spacecraft and the surface point in
   *                           body-fixed.
   *   @history 2012-05-04 Steven Lambright - Re-enabled a safety check in the DemRadius() method
   *                           which was needed due to Projection not uniformly handling Null
   *                           inputs. Fixes #807.
   *   @history 2012-07-06 Debbie A. Cook - Updated Spice members to be more compliant with Isis
   *                           coding standards. References #972.
   *   @history 2012-09-06 Steven Lambright and Stuart Sides - Changed the constructors to take
   *                           Cube instead of Pvl to prevent redundant parsing. This
   *                           should eventually be refactored into a CubeLabel or similar object
   *                           so that an actual cube isn't required in the future, but for now
   *                           this enables the control net GUI to create a camera from a cube
   *                           with no dimensions in the label.
   *   @history 2012-10-10 Debbie A. Cook - Moved the functionality related to the shape model into
   *                           new classes:  ShapeModel, EllipsoidShape, DemShape, and
   *                           EquatorialCylindricalShape.  Also modified to use new Target class.
   *                           References #775 and #1114
   *   @history 2012-10-25 Jeannie Backer - Changed resolution() method to lower
   *                           camel case. References #1181.
   *   @history 2012-03-04 Tracie Sucharski - Added new method, PixelIfovOffsets, which will return
   *                           the ifov offsets from the center of the pixel in mm.  This is a
   *                           virtual method and if not implemented in the specific instrument
   *                           camera, this class will throw an error.  References #1604.
   *   @history 2015-08-11 Ian Humphrey and Makayla Shepherd - Added pure virtual methods to return
   *                           the long and short spacecraft and instrument names.
   *   @history 2015-10-01 Jeannie Backer - Made improvements to documentation and brought code
   *                           closer to ISIS coding standards. References #1438
   *   @history 2017-03-23 Kris Becker - Added support for occlusion checks. Modified
   *                            SetLocalGround(bool backCheck) to make a callback to the
   *                            ShapeModel::isOccludedFrom() to test for point
   *                            visability.
   *   @history 2021-02-17 Kristin Berry, Jesse Mapel, and Stuart Sides - Made several functions
   *                           virtual and moved look vector member variable to protected. Ensured
   *                           that m_newLookB always initializes to the same value.
