   *
   *   @history 2005-11-09 Tracie Sucharski - Added HasProjection method.
   *   @history 2006-04-11 Tracie Sucharski - Added IgnoreProjection method and p_ignoreProjection
   *                           so that the Camera is used rather than Projection.
   *   @history 2006-04-19 Elizabeth Miller - Added SpacecraftRoll method
   *   @history 2006-06-08 Elizabeth Miller - Added static Distance method that calculates the
   *                           distance between 2 lat/lon pts (given the radius)
   *   @history 2006-07-25 Elizabeth Miller - Fixed bug in Distance method
   *   @history 2006-07-31 Elizabeth Miller - Added OffNadirAngle method and removed
   *                           SpacecraftRoll() method
   *   @history 2007-06-11 Debbie A. Cook - Added overloaded method SetUniversalGround that includes
   *                           a radius argument and method RawFocalPlanetoImage() to handle
   *                           the common functionality between the SetUniversalGround methods.
   *   @history 2008-01-28 Christopher Austin - Added error throw when minlon range isn't set beyond
   *                           initialization.
   *   @history 2008-02-15 Stacy Alley - In the GroundRangeResolution () method we had to subtract
   *                           0.5 when looking at the far left of pixels and add 0.5 to ensure we
   *                           are seeing the far right of pixels.
   *   @history 2008-05-21 Steven Lambright - Fixed boundary condition in the
   *                           GroundRangeResolution() method.
   *   @history 2008-06-18 Christopher Austin - Fixed documentation errors
   *   @history 2008-07-15 Steven Lambright - Added NaifStatus calls
   *   @history 2008-07-24 Steven Lambright - Fixed memory leaks: the alpha cube, distortion map,
   *                           focal plane map, sky map, detector map, and ground map were not being
   *                           deleted.
   *   @history 2008-08-08 Steven Lambright - Added the LoadCache() method which tries to find the
   *                           correct time range and calls Spice::CreateCache
   *   @history 2008-09-10 Steven Lambright - Added the geometric tiling methods in order to
   *                           optimize push frame cameras and prevent corruption of data when
   *                           running cam2map with push frame cameras
   *   @history 2008-11-13 Janet Barrett - Added the GroundAzimuth method. This method computes and
   *                           returns the ground azimuth between the ground point and another point
   *                           of interest, such as the subspacecraft point or the subsolar point.
   *                           The ground azimuth is the clockwise angle on the ground between a
   *                           line drawn from the ground point to the North pole of the body and a
   *                           line drawn from the ground point to the point of interest (such as
   *                           the subsolar point or the subspacecraft point).
   *   @history 2009-01-05 Steven Lambright - Added InCube method
   *   @history 2009-03-02 Steven Lambright - This class now keeps track of the current child band,
   *                           has more error checks, and now hopefully resets state when methods
   *                           like GroundRangeResolution are called.
   *   @history 2009-05-21 Steven Lambright - The geometric tiling hint can now be 2,2 as a special
   *                           case meaning no tiling will be used (the initial box will be a 2x2
   *                           box - only the 4 corners - is the idea behind using this value).
   *   @history 2009-05-22 Debbie A. Cook - Added Resolution method for Sensor (parent) virtual
   *   @history 2009-06-05 Mackenzie Boyd - Updated samson truthdata
   *   @history 2009-07-08 Janet Barrett - Added RadarGroundMap and RadarSlantRangeMap as friends to
   *                           this class so that they have access to the SetFocalLength() method.
   *                           The Radar instrument does not have a focal length and these classes
   *                           need to be able to change the focal length value each time the slant
   *                           range changes. This insures that the detector resolution always comes
   *                           out to the pixel width/height for the Radar instrument.
   *   @history 2009-07-09 Debbie A. Cook - Set p_hasIntersection in SetImage if successful instead
   *                           of just returning the bool to that other methods will know a ground
   *                           point was successfully set.
   *   @history 2009-08-03 Debbie A. Cook - Added computation of tolerance to support change in
   *                           Spice class for supporting downsizing of Spice tables
   *   @history 2009-08-14 Debbie A. Cook - Corrected alternate tolerance
   *   @history 2009-08-17 Debbie A. Cook - Added default tolerance for sky images
   *   @history 2009-08-19 Janet Barrett - Fixed the GroundAzimuth method so that it checks the
   *                           quadrant that the subspacecraft or subsolar point lies in to
   *                           calculate the correct azimuth value.
   *   @history 2009-08-28 Steven Lambright - Added GetCameraType method and returned enumeration
   *                           value
   *   @history 2009-09-23  Tracie Sucharski - Convert negative longitudes coming out of
   *                           NAIF's reclat() when computing azimuths.
   *   @history 2009-12-14  Steven Lambright - BasicMapping(...) will now populate the map Pvl
   *                           parameter with a valid Pvl
   *   @history 2010-03-19 Debbie A. Cook - Added members p_ckFrameId and p_ckReferenceId and
   *                           members SetCkFrameId(), SetCkReferenceId(), CkFrameId(), and
   *                           CkReferenceId() needed by the ckwriter application
   *   @history 2010-03-29 Debbie A. Cook - Modified SetCkFrameid and SetCkReferenceFrame to set new
   *                           bool value p_ckwriteReady to true if the kernels have values and
   *                           false if they don't instead of bombing.
   *   @history 2010-11-04 Steven Lambright - Added SetGround() methods with the SurfacePoint
   *                           version being commented out until the SurfacePoint class is available
   *   @history 2010-11-09 Eric Hyer - Added GetLocalNormal() and LocalPhotometricAngles() methods
   *   @history 2010-11-22 Janet Barrett - Added checks to make sure that the normal can be
   *                           determined for DEM surface. Also modified the LocalPhotometricAngles
   *                           method to report if the angles could successfully be calculated.
   *   @history 2011-01-14 Travis Addair - Added new CK/SPK accessor methods, pure virtual in
   *                           Camera, implemented in mission specific cameras.
   *   @history 2011-01-14 Kris Becker - Added the (pure) virtual methods CkFrameId(),
   *                           CkReferenceId(), SpkTargetId(), SpkCenterId() and SpkReferenceId().
   *                           Camera model developers must provide, at a minimum, implementations
   *                           for CkFrameId(), CkReferenceId() and SpkReferenceId().
   *                           A determination must be made if default implementations of
   *                           SpkTargetId() and SpkCenterId() are sufficient.  These methods are
   *                           required in order to write proper CKs and SPKs NAIF kernels for
   *                           instruments from updated pointing and position data; Removed
   *                           SetCkFrameId() and SetCkReferenceId() and their implementations as
   *                           the aforementioned routines replace them; also corrected a bug in the
   *                           computation of North, Sun and Spacecraft azimuths when a shape model
   *                           is present/active. The call to LocalRadius() should be
   *                           LocalRadius(lat,lon) in these cases. (Note at this time, those two
   *                           routines return meters and kilometers, respectively - we need to
   *                           address this inconsistancy!)
   *   @history 2011-01-25 Eric Hyer - SurfacePoint class now exists so uncommented Steven's
   *                           new SetGround() methods (see history for 2010-11-04)
   *   @history 2011-01-26  Steven Lambright - ComputeAzimuth now takes a Distance for the radius.
   *                           The LocalRadius() methods now return instances of the Distance class.
   *   @history 2011-02-10 Jeannie Walldren - Moved code from LoadCache() methods to create new
   *                           methods CacheSize() and StartEndEphemerisTime().  Removed unused
   *                           input parameter from LoadCache(). Set pointers to null in
   *                           constructor. Added documentation to methods, enum, and private
   *                           variables.
   *   @history 2011-02-09 Steven Lambright - Interfaces using Latitude, Longitude, and SurfacePoint
   *                           are now more efficient. Updated to work with changes to the parent.
   *                           Now uses more abstraction internally also. These changes were for
   *                           readability (you have more explicit units and less of a change to
   *                           misuse them).
   *   @history 2011-02-11 Steven Lambright - Moved Distance() method to SurfacePoint
   *   @history 2011-02-18 Steven Lambright - Fixed a problem where using a planetographic mapping
   *                           group in GroundRange would still output planetocentric latitudes.
   *   @history 2011-05-03 Jeannie Walldren - Added Isis Disclaimer to files.
   *   @history 2012-01-19 Janet Barrett - Fixes issue #625 - Fixed a problem with the ground
   *                           azimuth calculation in the GroundAzimuth method. The algorithm being
   *                           used was the Napier's analogies and was not providing the correct
   *                           azimuth value. The Napier's analogies also have the weakness of
   *                           producing a divide by zero error. The new algorithm being used is the
   *                           spherical law of cosines for sides which comes out of the
   *                           "CRC Standard Mathematical Tables and Formulae 30th Edition on page
   *                           469.
   *   @history 2012-06-01 Janet Barrett - Modified the GroundAzimuth method to detect which
   *                           hemisphere the ground point is in so that the closer pole will be
   *                           used to obtain the azimuth value. If the closer pole is the South
   *                           pole, then the azimuth is adjusted to be relative to the North pole.
   *   @history 2012-06-04 Janet Barrett - Got rid of redundant calls to Sample(), Line(), and
   *                           SetImage() in the ComputeAzimuth method.
   *   @history 2012-07-06 Debbie A. Cook - Updated Spice members to be more compliant with Isis
   *                           coding standards. References #972.
   *   @history 2012-10-12 Debbie A. Cook - Updated to use new Target and ShapeModel classes.
   *                           References Mantis ticket #775 and #1114.
   *   @history 2012-10-25 Jeannie Backer - Changed resolution() method to lower
   *                           camel case. References #1181.
   *   @history 2012-11-20 Janet Barrett - Fixed a problem with the GroundAzimuth method so
   *                           that the azimuth value is calculated correctly for radar data.
   *                           Fixes #1117.
   *   @history 2012-04-24 Jeannie Backer - Added a programmer error if NorthAzimuth() is called on
   *                           a plane projection since this value is meaningless for ring plane
   *                           projections. References #775.
   *   @history 2012-12-20 Debbie A. Cook - Changed to use TProjection and RingPlaneProjection
   *                           instead of Projection as needed.  References #775.
   *   @history 2013-03-04 Tracie Sucharski - Added new method, PixelIfovOffsets, which will return
   *                           the ifov offsets,in x and y, from the center of the pixel in mm.  The
   *                           default camera offsets will be half of the pixel pitch in both the x
   *                           and y directions.  References #1604.
   *   @history 2014-04-17 Jeannie Backer - Modified ComputeAzimuth() to return an Isis::Null if the
   *                           method fails (instead of -1.0). Add a check in ComputeAzimuth() to
   *                           make sure the "SetUniversalGround()" call succeeds, if not, reset to
   *                           the original sample/line and return Null. References #1659.
   *   @history 2015-03-14 Jeannie Backer - Modified GetLocalNormal() to call non-DEM shapes'
   *                           calculateLocalNormal() with an empty vector of neighbors since only
   *                           DemShape uses this vector. References #2035.
   *   @history 2015-04-30 Jeannie Backer - Fixed bug in GetLocalNormal() introduced in prior
   *                           check-in. Fixes #2243.
   *   @history 2015-05-15 Kris Becker - Set ShapeModel state in SetImage() to reflect no
   *                           intersection before attempting to map to surface. Fixes #2252.
   *   @history 2015-09-01 Ian Humphrey and Makayla Shepherd - Modified unit test to override
   *                           Sensor's pure virtual methods.
   *   @history 2015-10-16 Ian Humphrey - Added protected members for spacecraft and instrument
   *                           names as well as public member getters. Updated unit test.
   *                           References #2335.
   *   @history 2016-06-27 Kelvin Rodriguez - Added member function to compute celestial north
   *                           clock angle. References #2365
   *   @history 2016-08-01 Curtis Rose - Changed return values of resolutions from -1 to Isis::Null.
   *                           Fixes #2065.
   *   @history 2016-08-16 Tyler Wilson - Added ObliqueDectectorResolution,ObliqueLineResolution,
   *                           ObliqueSampleResolution, and ObliquePixelResolution functions
   *                           which give greatly improved approximations compared to their
   *                           non-oblique counterpart functions when the Look vector is pointing
   *                           off nadir and near the limb.  Fixes #476.  References #4100.
   *   @history 2016-10-16 Jesse Mapel - Added exposureDuration methods to access pixel exposure
   *                           durations.  References #4476.
   *   @history 2016-10-18 Kristin Berry - Added a new virtual SetImage which includes a time
   *                           offset. Refactored SetImage to minimize repeated code by creating
   *                           helper functions SetImageSkyMapProjection() and
   *                           SetImageMapProjection(). Updated unitTest. References #4476.
   *   @history 2016-10-21 Jesse Mapel - Modified exposureDuration(sample, line, band) to default
   *                           to using the band the camera is set to. References #4476.
   *   @history 2016-10-21 Jeannie Backer - Reorder method signatures and member variable

   *   @history 2016-12-02 Victor Silva - Made changes to GetLocalNormal to calculate local normal
   *                           accurately for LRO by changing 4 corner surrounding points from adding
   *                           0.5 to adding 0.5 - DBL_MIN. Fixes #4560.
   *   @history 2017-03-03 Tyler Wilson - Updated the oblique detector resolution function to correct
   *                           an error in the original formula, and updated the documention for this
