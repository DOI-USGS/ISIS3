   * @brief This class defines a field of view
   *  
   * This class defines a field of view for a given camera.  Field of views are returned as point
   * clouds defining the boundary of the field of view. The number of vertices is instrment
   * dependent. The default  Camera::PixelIfovOffsets assumes a square pixel and simply returns
   * the offsets of the four corner vertices in microns from the current pixel center. If the
   * instruments pixels are not square, the Camera::PixelIfov will  need to be implemented in the
   * the instrument's camera model.  For an example, see VimsCamera::PixelIfov().
