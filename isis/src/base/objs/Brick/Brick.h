   * @brief  Buffer for containing a three dimensional section of an image
   *
   * This class is a Buffer. The shape of the buffer is three dimensional in the
   * line, sample, and band directions. This class provides a random access
   * window into a cube. The position can be set to any line, sample and band,
   * including outside the image.
