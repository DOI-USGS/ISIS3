   *   @history 2012-12-21 Debbie A. Cook - Cleaned up intersectSurface method to
   *                           reflect changes made to ShapeModel class.  References #1343.
   *   @history 2015-04-30 Jeannie Backer - Added isDEM() method. References #2243.
   *   @history 2015-07-21 Kristin Berry - Added NaifStatus::CheckErrors() to see if any NAIF errors
   *                           were signaled. References #2248.
   *   @history 2016-06-13 Kelvin Rodriguez - Removed redundant contructor
   *                           EllipsoidShape(Target, Pvl). References #2214
   *   @history 2017-05-19 Tyler Wilson - calculateSurfaceNormal() and calculateDefaultNormal()
   *                           now call calculateLocalNormal(), which calculates the normal
   *                           vector to an ellipsoid.  Prior to this, they were calling
   *                           ShapeModel::calculateEllipsoidalSurfaceNormal() function
   *                           which was incorrectly returning the normal vector to a sphere and not
   *                           an ellipsoid.  Fixes #1028.
   *   @history 2017-06-07 Kristin Berry - Added a using declaration so that the new
   *                            intersectSurface methods in ShapeModel are accessible by
   *                            EllipsoidShape.
