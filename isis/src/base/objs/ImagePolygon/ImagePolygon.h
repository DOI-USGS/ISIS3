   * @brief Create cube polygons, read/write polygons to blobs
   *
   * This class creates polygons defining an image boundary, reads
   * the polygon from a cube blob, and writes a polygon to a cube
   * blob.  The GEOS (Geometry Engine Open Source) package is used
   * to create and manipulate the polygons. See
   * http://geos.refractions.net for information about this
   * package.

   * @history 2006-05-17 Stuart Sides Renamed from PolygonTools and moved the
   *                                  geos::GeometryFactory to the new PolygonTools
   * @history 2007-01-04 Tracie Sucharski, Fixed bug in Fix360Poly, on
   *                non-pole images after splitting at the 360 boundary,
   *                wasn't insuring that start and end points of polygon were
   *                the same.
   * @history 2007-01-05 Tracie Sucharski, Made a change to the SetImage
   *                method.  Cannot make the assumption that if a sample/line
   *                returns a lat/lon, that the lat/lon will return a sample/line.
   *                This was found using a Moc WA, global image, sample 1, line 1
   *                returned a lat/lon, but entering that lat/lon does not return a
   *                valid sample/line.
   * @history 2007-01-08 Tracie Sucharski, Fixed bugs in the ToImage and
   *                ToGround class for images that contain a pole.
   *
   * @history 2007-01-19  Tracie Sucharski,  Comment out the ToGround method.
   *
   * @history 2007-01-31  Tracie Sucharski,  Add WKT method to return WKT polygon
   *                            as a string.
   * @history 2007-02-06  Tracie Sucharski,  Added band parameter to Create
   *                            method and call UniversalGroundMap::SetBand.
   * @history 2007-05-04  Robert Sucharski, with Jeff, Stuart, and
   *                               Tracie's blessing, moved the WKT method to the
   *                               PolygonTools class.
   * @history 2007-07-26  Tracie Sucharski,  Added ss,sl,ns,nl to constructor
   *                            for sub-poly creation.
   * @history 2007-11-09  Tracie Sucharski,  Remove WKT method since the geos
   *                            package know has a method to return a WKT
   *                            string
   * @history 2008-03-17  Tracie Sucharski, Added try/catch block to Create
   *                            and Fix360Poly to catch geos exceptions.
   *
   *  @history 2008-06-18 Stuart Sides - Fixed doc error
   *  @history 2008-08-18 Steven Lambright - Updated to work with geos3.0.0
   *           instead of geos2. Mostly namespace changes.
   *  @history 2008-12-10 Steven Koechle - Split pole code into seperate function,
   *           chanded the way FixPoly360 did its intersection to handle a
   *           multipolygon being returned.
   *  @history 2008-12-10 Steven Lambright - Fixed logical problem which could
   *           happen when the limb of the planet was on the left and was the
   *           first thing found in the FindPoly method.
   *  @history 2009-01-06 Steven Koechle - Changed Constructor, removed backwards
   *           compatibility for footprint name.
   *  @history 2009-01-28 Steven Lambright - Fixed memory leaks
   *  @history 2009-02-20 Steven Koechle - Fixed Fix360Poly to use the
   *           PolygonTools Intersect method.
   *  @history 2009-04-17 Steven Koechle - Rewrote most of the class. Implemented
   *           a left-hand rule AI walking algotithm in the walkpoly method. Pole
   *           and 360 boundary logic was more integrated and simplified. Method
   *           of finding the first point was seperated into its own method.
   *  @history 2009-05-06 Steven Koechle - Fixed Error where a NULL polygon was
   *           being written.
   *  @history 2009-05-28 Steven Lambright - This program will no longer generate
   *           invalid polygons and should use despike as a correction algorithm
   *           if it is necessary.
   *  @history 2009-05-28 Stuart Sides - Added a new argument to Create for
   *           controling the quality of the polygon.
   *  @history 2009-05-28 Steven Lambright - Moved the quality parameter in the
   *           argument list, improved speed and the edges of files (and subareas)
   *           should be checked if the algorithm reaches them now. Fixed the
   *           sub-area capabilities.
   *  @history 2009-06-16 Christopher Austin - Fixed WalkPoly() to catch large
   *           pixel increments that ( though snapping ) skip over the starting
   *           point. Also skip the first left turn in FindNextPoint() to prevent
   *           double point checking as well as errors with snapping.
   *  @history 2009-06-17 Christopher Austin - Removed p_name. Uses parent Name()
   *  @history 2009-06-18 Christopher Austin - Changes starting point skipping
   *           solution to a snap. Added fix for polygons that form
   *           self-intersecting polygons due to this first point snapping.
   *  @history 2009-06-19 Christopher Austin - Temporarily reverted for backport,
   *           fixed truthdata for SpiceRotation, re-commited with all updates
   *  @history 2009-07-01 Christopher Austin - Added Emission and Phase Angle
   *           tolerences.
   *  @history 2009-07-09 Christopher Austin - Fixed range error in FixPolePoly()
   *           when no points cross, an overflow exception, as well as emission
   *           and incidence handling of poles.
   *  @history 2009-07-21 Christopher Austin - Added limb snapping along with
   *           internal corner searching. Fixed lat/lon crossing when samp/line
   *           does not cross. Removed the SetUniversalGround call in SetImage().
   *           Limbs are now detected and handled using an ellipsoid shape model
   *           if p_ellipsoid is true.
   *  @history 2009-07-28 Christopher Austin - Changed qualitiy increment to
   *           sample/line increment to remove unnecessary points from the
   *           polygon.
   *  @history 2009-08-05 Christopher Austin - Added pole meridian proper polygon
   *           division.
   *  @history 2009-08-20 Christopher Austin - Added meridian walking and subpixel
   *           accuracy.
   *  @history 2009-08-28 Christopher Austin - Fixed a memory bounds error.
   *  @history 2010-02-08 Christopher Austin - Fixed an infinite loop which
   *           revisited the starting point, and added 360 meridian crossing
   *  @history 2010-02-17 Christopher Austin - Fixed two more infinite looping
   *           issues, including a cycle fix which occured during Emission Angle
   *           and Incidence Angle restrictions
   *  @history 2011-05-11 Steven Lambright - Now works with projected images.
   *  @history 2011-05-12 Christopher Austin - Added validSample/LineDim()
   *                                           functionality.
   *  @history 2011-07-01 Travis Addair - Added outlier check to
   *           FindFirstPoint() to avoid choosing a first point without any
   *           valid neighbors (i.e., an outlier).
   *  @history 2012-05-14 Steven Lambright - Added safety to the calcImageBorderCoordinates method,
   *                          along with the validSampleDim and validLineDim methods. This fixes
   *                          seg faults. Fixes #686.
   *  @history 2012-07-16 Steven Lambright - Fixed a bug in WalkPoly() that caused crashing
   *                          periodically due to accessing a vector outside of it's bounds
   *                          (negative indices). This was in the 'triangle' (loop) detection code.
   *                          Fixes #994.
