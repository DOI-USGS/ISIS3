/**
 *  @brief Collector/container for arbitrary items
 * 
 *  Used to contain types with iterators of const and non-const conditions.
 *  This is a multimap that contains arbitrary keys with arbitrary elements.  It
 *  is intended to be used for pointers and copyable objects.  They should be
 *  rather efficient in the copy out operation so large objects may not be
 *  suitable or classes that do not have a good copy operator.  During testing
 *  it was noted that an object is copied up to four times and destroyed three
 *  times upon an add() operation.
 * 
 *  This class is implemented using policies.  The ComparePolicy is used to test
 *  key elements such as strings and double values.  The NoCaseStringCompare
 *  policy is provided that expedites case insensitive string key comparisons.
 *  The RobustFloatCompare implements the comparison of double or float key
 *  types.  Direct comparisons of floats can be problematic due to round off and
 *  storage manifestations of these values in conputers.   The default policy,
 *  SimpleCompare, does a simple parameter to key equality test.
 * 
 *  The RemovalPolicy is provided when a map value is removed from the list.
 *  This allows pointers and arrays to be stored in the map as well.  To store
 *  pointers, use PointerRemoval and for arrays there is the ArrayRemoval
 *  policy.  The default is the NoopRemoval policy which simply lets the
 *  destructor handle removals.
 * 
 *  The CopyPolicy is necessary to properly handle the copying of elements.
 *  This is especially important for pointers and arrays.  In order to minimize
 *  difficult passing strategies, map elements are passed by address and the
 *  return type is the element type.  DefaultCopy simply copies the elements as
 *  is relying on the element T assigment operator to do the right thing. For
 *  pointers to objects, the PointerCopy allocates the object using the copy
 *  constructor.  One could provide a similar operator assuming a clone()
 *  method existed for the type T element. The ArrayCopy policy is left to the
 *  user to provide their own as it cannot support arrays of varying length.
 *  (One should use std::vector instead!) Users can supply their own CopyPolicy
 *  that need only expose a copy(cont T *src) method.
 * 
 *  Here are some examples that demonstrate how this policy-based template class
 *  can be used:
 * 
 *  @code
 * // Create a unique string key list that stores double floating point values.
 * // Use the default removal and copy policies but allow testing for character
 * // keys without regard to case via the NoCaseStringCompare.
 *  #include "CollectorMap.h"
 * 
 *  CollectorMap<std::string, double, NoCaseStringCompare > dmap;
 *  cout << "\nSize of double map = " << dmap.size() << endl;
 *  dmap.add("one", 1.0);
 *  dmap.add("two", 2.0);
 *  cout << "Size of double map = " << dmap.size() << endl;
 *
 *  cout << "One = " << dmap.get("one") << endl;
 *  cout << "Two = " << dmap.get("Two") << endl;
 *
 *  const double &one = dmap.get("one");
 *  cout << "\nTest Const one = " << one << endl;
 *
 *  dmap.remove("one");
 *  @endcode
 * 
 *  Using this class internal to classes is perhaps where it may be applied more
 *  frequently.  The example below shows how to declare an integer key using
 *  pointers to classes:
 *
 *  @code
 * #include "CollectorMap.h"
 * 
 *  class ClassTest {
 *   public:
 *    ClassTest(int n = 0) : _n(n) {  }
 *    ~ClassTest() {  }
 *    int Ident() const { return (_n); }
 *   private:
 *    int _n;
 *  };
 * 
 * 
 * //  Typedefs are sometimes convenient in these cases
 *  typedef CollectorMap<int, ClassTest *, SimpleCompare,
 *                       PointerRemoval, PointerCopy> PointerMap;
 * 
 *  PointerMap ctest2;
 *  ctest2.add(4,new ClassTest(4));
 *  ctest2.add(5,new ClassTest(5));
 *  ctest2.add(6,new ClassTest(6));
 *  ctest2.add(7,new ClassTest(7));
 *
 *  cout << "Remove ClassTest 6\n";
 *  ctest2.remove(6);
 *
 * //  Creates a copy of ctest2 using the PointerCopy policy
 *  PointerMap map2(ctest2);
 * 
 *  cout << "Find element 7: "  << map2.find(7)->Ident() << endl;
 * 
 *  @endcode
 * 
 *  And, finally, an example of how to use duplicate keys:
 *
 *  @code
 *  #include "CollectorMap.h"
 *
 *  typedef CollectorMap<int,std::string> IntStr;
 *  IntStr dupstr(IntStr::DuplicateKeys);
 *  dupstr.add(1,"One");
 *  dupstr.add(1, "One #2");
 *  dupstr.add(1,"One #3");
 *  dupstr.add(2,"Two");
 *  dupstr.add(2,"Two #2");
 *  dupstr.add(3,"Three");
 *
 *  cout << "Size of Dup object: " << dupstr.size() << endl;
 *  cout << "Number Ones:   " << dupstr.count(1) << endl;
 *  cout << "Number Twos:   " << dupstr.count(2) << endl;
 *  cout << "Number Threes: " << dupstr.count(3) << endl;
 *  cout << "Number Fours:  " << dupstr.count(4) << endl;
 *
 *  IntStr::CollectorConstIter isIter;
 *  int j = 0;
 *  for (isIter = dupstr.begin() ; isIter != dupstr.end() ; ++isIter, j++) {
 *       cout << "IntStr[" << j << "] = {" << isIter->first << ", "
 *            << isIter->second << "}, Index: " << dupstr.index(isIter->first)
 *            << endl;
 *       cout << "Nth Test Ident       = " << dupstr.getNth(j) << endl;
 *  }
 *  @endcode
 * 
 *  The output of the above example is:
 *  @code
 * Size of Dup object: 6
 * Number Ones:   3
 * Number Twos:   2
 * Number Threes: 1
 * Number Fours:  0
 * IntStr[0] = {1, One}, Index: 0
 * Nth Test Ident       = One
 * IntStr[1] = {1, One #2}, Index: 0
 * Nth Test Ident       = One #2
 * IntStr[2] = * {1, One #3}, Index: 0
 * Nth Test Ident       = One #3
 * IntStr[3] * = {2, Two}, Index: 3
 * Nth Test Ident       = Two
 * IntStr[4] = * {2, Two #2}, Index: 3
 * Nth Test Ident       = Two #2
 * IntStr[5] = * {3, Three}, Index: 5
 * Nth Test Ident = Three
