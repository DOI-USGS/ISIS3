Unit test for NaifDskShape.

Default constructor.
Shape name is  "DSK"
Shape is DEM type?  "No"

Construct NaifDskShape object from a plate model.
Try to intersect surface at obsPos (0,0,0) and lookDir (1,1,1)
Intersection successful?  "No"

Construct NaifDskShape object from cube labels with ShapeModel=DSK file.
Try to intersect surface at obsPos (0,0,1000) and lookDir (0,-1,-1)
Intersection successful?      "No"
Try to intersect surface at obsPos (1000,0,0) and ground point (1,0,0)
Intercept X =  0.28911
Intercept Y =  0
Intercept Z =  0
Intersection successful?      "Yes"

Construct NaifDskShape object from cube labels with ElevationModel=DSK file.
Try to intersect surface at obsPos (1000,0,0) and lookDir (-1,0,0)
Intersection successful?      "Yes"
Intersection valid?  true
Intercept is null?   "No"
intercept surface point (location)   =  "( 289.110306976744, 0.0, 0.0 )" meters


Now that we have a surface point, testing intersectSurface using surfacepoint from parent class...
Do we have an intersection?  true
Testing intersectSurface using lat/lon from parent class...
Do we have an intersection?  true

Find local radius given lat/lon
Local radius at ( 0 ,  0 ) is valid?  true
Local radius:                 289.11 meters

Access the associated NaifDskPlateModel.
Plate is valid?               true
Plate file name:              "hay_a_amica_5_itokawashape_v1_0_512q"
Plate size:                   3145728
Number of plates:             3145728
Number of vertices:           1579014

Try to calculate norms using valid shape model...
Has intercept normal?                 true
Normal set from Intercept:            QVector(0.864171, -0.148718, 0.48072)
Has default normal?                   true
Default normal:                       QVector(1, 0, 0)
Has local normal?                     true
Local normal from neighbor points:    QVector(0.864171, -0.148718, 0.48072)

================================= Error Throws ==================================
Construct NaifDskShape object from cube labels with ShapeModel=Null.
**USER ERROR** NAIF DSK file [Null] does not exist.

Thrown by setLocalNormalFromIntercept() - Failed to find intercept. 

Thrown by calculateLocalNormal() - Failed to find intercept for normal vector. 
**PROGRAMMER ERROR** Intercept point does not exist - cannot provide normal vector.

Thrown by ellipsoidNormal() - No intersection. 
**PROGRAMMER ERROR** An intersection must be defined before computing the surface normal.

Thrown by ellipsoidNormal() - Invalid intersection. 
**PROGRAMMER ERROR** The surface point intersection must be valid to compute the surface normal.

Thrown by ellipsoidNormal() - Invalid target. 
**PROGRAMMER ERROR** A valid target must be defined before computing the surface normal.
