   * @brief Serial Number composer
   *
   * A Serial Number is a unique identification for some object such as an
   * Isis cube. A Serial Number for a specific object must be repeatable. This
   * class is intended to be used to create all Serial Numbers for Isis.

   *  @todo This is only a temporary version. The code needs to be modified
   *  to use a PVL file to determine which keywords to use to create the
   *  Serial Number
   *
   *  @history 2008-01-08 Christpher Austin - Original Version,
   *           a derivative of the previous SerialNumber class
   *
   *  @history 2008-05-09 Steven Lambright - Optimized the
   *           FindObservationTranslation method
   *  @history 2020-03-03 Kristin Berry - Updated to use translation files migrated into source.
