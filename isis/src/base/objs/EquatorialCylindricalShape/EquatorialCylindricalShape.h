   * @brief Define shapes and provide utilities for shapes stored as Isis3 EquatorialCylindrical map
   *
   * This class will define shapes of Isis3 target bodies with the shape defined by an
   * EquatorialCylindrical map, as well as provide utilities to retrieve radii and photometric
   * information for the intersection point.

   *   @history 2012-12-19 Debbie A. Cook Added a check for an invalid radius in the
   *                           intersectSurface() method, that was causing applications to hang.
   *                           Also return a false if no ellipsoid itersection is found.
   *   @history 2015-07-21 Kristin Berry - Added NaifStatus::CheckErrors() to see if any NAIF errors
   *                           were signaled. References #2248.
   *   @history 2015-10-01 Jeannie Backer - Made improvements to documentation and brought code
   *                           closer to ISIS coding standards. Removed check for ellipsoid
   *                           intersection in intersectSurface() method to prevent early return
   *                           and attempt the iterative method even when the ellipsoid is not
   *                           intersected. Fixes #1438
   *   @history 2018-01-05 Cole Neubauer - Fixed units conversion in intersectSurface so that the
   *                           loop is stepping by radians per pixel, as recommended by Jeff
   *                           Anderson (LROC team). Fixes #5245
