   * @ingroup Low Level Cube IO
   *
   * @brief Handles converting buffers to and from disk.
   *
   * This class handles converting buffers to and from disk. This class holds
   *   the cube chunks in memory and is capable of reading and writing them. It
   *   asks the caching algorithms to recommend cube chunks to not keep in
   *   memory. Children need to call setChunkSizes() in their constructor.
   *
   * This class handles all of the virtual band conversions. This class also
   *   guarantees that unwritten cube data ends up read and written as NULLs.
   *   The default caching algorithm is a RegionalCachingAlgorithm.

   *   @history 2011-06-27 Steven Lambright - Added addCachingAlgorithm()
   *   @history 2011-07-18 Jai Rideout and Steven Lambright - Added
   *                           unimplemented copy constructor and assignment
   *                           operator.
   *   @history 2011-07-18 Jai Rideout and Steven Lambright - getDataFile() is
   *                           no longer const, along with readRaw() and
   *                           writeRaw().
   *   @history 2011-11-23 Jai Rideout - Added fix to findCubeChunks() and
   *                           findIntersection() so that requested areas that
   *                           are outside of the virtual bands of the cube will
   *                           no longer fail, but instead will fill the buffer
   *                           with nulls.
   *   @history 2012-02-17 Steven Lambright - The read() method is now const -
   *                           the caching should be transparent to the API. It
   *                           is still important to note that you cannot call
   *                           read() and write() simultaneously - Cube is
   *                           guaranteeing this. Backgrounded writes are now
   *                           implemented and fully supported. Timing tests
   *                           show results like this:
   *                           Before:
   *                           User: 358.71 Kernel: 38.29 Total Elapsed: 6:49.83
   *                           After:
   *                           User: 380.01 Kernel: 44.97 Total Elapsed: 6:19.96
   *                             User- user-space CPU time consumed.
   *                             Kernel- kernel-space CPU time consumed.
   *                           The CPU consumption and kernel time consumption
   *                           goes up, but the overall run time is lower. This
   *                           makes the option perfectly viable for typical
   *                           multi-core desktop solutions. Turning off the
   *                           cube write optimization results in equivalent run
   *                           times as before implementation. These time tests
   *                           were run before the adaptive cache flush size was
   *                           added, which improved performance further.
   *                           References #727.
   *   @history 2012-06-06 Jeff Anderson - The read() method was modified to
   *                           improve the speed for small buffer sizes as seen
   *                           in ProcessByBoxcar and ProcessRubbersheet.  The
   *                           internal cache was always checked to be minimized
   *                           which is slow for every read.  Now the cache is
   *                           only mimimized if it changed in size.
   *                           Reference #894.
   *   @history 2014-04-07 Kimberly Oyama and Stuart Sides - Modified the findCubeChunks,
   *                            writeIntoDouble, and writeIntoRaw methods to handle
   *                            repeating virtual bands. Fixes #1927.
   *   @history 2014-09-30 Ian Humphrey - Modified read method to correctly access virtual bands
   *                           when cube dimensions and buffer shape are same size. Fixes #1689.
   *   @history 2015-01-30 Ian Humphrey - Modified destructor to free m_writThreadMutex to
   *                           prevent memory leaks upon destruction. Fixes #2082.
   *   @history 2016-04-21 Makayla Shepherd - Added UnsignedWord pixel type handling.
   *   @history 2016-06-21 Kris Becker - Properly forward declare QPair as struct not class
   *   @history 2016-08-28 Kelvin Rodriguez - updateLabels now a pure virtual, it had no
   *                           implementation causing warnings in clang. Part of OS X 10.11 porting.
   *                           QPair forward declaration now properly claims it as a struct.
   *   @history 2017-09-22 Cole Neubauer - Fixed documentation. References #4807
