   * @brief Namespace to contain type definitions of NAIF DSK fundamentals 
   *  
   * This NAIF DSK utility provides the means to a TIN.  Needed are types that 
   * define efficient implemenations of vectors, vertices and triangles (plates). 
   * The TNT library is used to specify these fundamental types due to its 
   * efficeint passing and memory manaegement mechanisms.

   *   @history 2013-12-05 Kris Becker  Original Version 
   *   @history 2015-03-08 Jeannie Backer - Moved implementation of validate() methods to cpp file.
   *                           Added qdebug formatters for typedefs so that they can be easily
   *                           printed in unitTests. Added class to ISIS trunk. References #2035
   *   @history 2017-06-28 Kris Becker - Updated DSK includes for NAIF N0066 release that now
   *                           includes the DSK formally. The includes are now all in SpiceUsr.h.
   *                           Removed SPICE includes from the cpp file as well. Fixes #4947.
