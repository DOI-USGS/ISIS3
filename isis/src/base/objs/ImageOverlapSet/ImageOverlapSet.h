   *  @history 2008-06-18 Christopher Austin - Fixed documentation
   *  @history 2008-08-18 Steven Lambright - Updated to work with geos3.0.0
   *           instead of geos2. Mostly namespace changes.
   *  @history 2008-11-24 Steven Lambright - Improved upon error reporting. Added
   *           the Errors() method.
   *  @history 2008-11-25 Steven Koechle - Moved Despike Methods from
   *           ImageOverlapSet to PolygonTools
   *  @history 2008-12-10 Steven Koechle - Moved MakeMultiPolygon Method from
   *           ImageOverlapSet to PolygonTools
   *  @history 2008-12-05 Steven Lambright - Checking footprints for validity now,
   *           fixed an issue with the intersection operator where an invalid but
   *           repairable polygon is produced, and fixed a memory leak.
   *  @history 2008-12-15 Steven Koechle - Fixed to read new footprint blob naming
   *           scheme.
   *  @history 2009-01-06 Steven Koechle - Removed backwards compatibility for old
   *           footprint blob name. Added a throw if footprints are invalid in an
   *           image.
   *  @history 2009-01-07 Steven Lambright & Christopher Austin - Fixed handling
   *           of Despike(...) throwing errors on empty polygons
   *  @history 2009-01-13 Steven Lambright - Deletes both overlaps if an
   *           intersection fails for an unknown reason.
   *  @history 2009-01-28 Steven Lambright - Fixed memory leaks
   *  @history 2009-03-12 Christopher Austin - Added the MULTIPOLYGON to
   *           HandleError() as the Keyword "Polygon"
   *  @history 2009-06-01 Christopher Austin - Changed the basic algorithm to
   *           improve results.
   *  @history 2009-06-01 Steven Lambright - Multi-threaded this object. Split
   *           code into smaller methods, now new elements are inserted next
   *           instead of appended to the end of the overlap list, and added more
   *           error-recovery solutions.
