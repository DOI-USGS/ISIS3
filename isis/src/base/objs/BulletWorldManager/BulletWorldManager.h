/**
 * @brief Bullet World manager maintains a proper state for target bodies
 *  
 * This class maintains the physics world created in Bullet-verse. This world is 
 * target-centric in that the center of the world is the center of the 
 * target (body-fixed) coordinate system. This could be changed to represent 
 * some other system (e.g., J2000), However this design allows one to operate on 
 * a per target basis. 
 *  
 * This class uses only the collision body world of Bullet, which is static and
 * will not be subject to simulation operations. 
 *  
 * This design also allows for a whole target body DEM to be loaded or a large 
 * body broken up into smaller parts of the whole if needed.
