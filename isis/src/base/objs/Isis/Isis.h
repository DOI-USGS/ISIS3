/**
 * @brief Base include file for all Isis applications
 *
 * This is not technically a class.  Instead it is the main include file
 * the must be placed at the beginning of every executable program. For
 * example:
 * @code
 * using namespace std;
 * #include "Isis.h"
 * @endcode
 * The include file
 * handles starting the Isis GUI, error messages, and a host of other
 * Isis related duties that should be performed in all Isis programs.
 * It actually contains the standard C++
 * declaration of main (i.e., int main (int argc, char *argv[])) and
 * invokes the function IsisMain which must
 * be supplied by the programmer. Therefore, your program should
 * always start as follows:
 * @code
 * using namespace std;
 * #include "Isis.h"
 * void IsisMain() {
 *   ...
 * }
 * @endcode
 * The Isis.h file includes code that catches all thrown exceptions.  It
 * first trys to catch and report Isis specific errors.  That is,
 * those thrown
 * within IsisMain or by Isis objects created in IsisMain.  It will
 * then catch C++ system type errors and respond accordingly.  This
 * eliminates the need for the application programmer to trap errors.
 * They may however, throw errors as necessary to indicate error
 * conditions within their application.
