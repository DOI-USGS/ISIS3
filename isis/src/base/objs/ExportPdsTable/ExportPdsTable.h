   * @brief Export a PDS table from an ISIS Table.
   *
   * This class ingests an ISIS Table and converts it to a PDS Table.
   *
   * @b NOTE: This class exports BINARY format PDS tables. The PDS Standards
   * Reference document indicates that for files containing multiple tables
   * with binary data, the records should be FIXED_LENGTH (not STREAM) and
   * that this value should be the length of the longest record in the file
   * (Appendix A, PDS Standards, last updated February 27, 2009). This
   * document also indicates that all table rows that are less than the fixed
   * record length value should be padded (ususally with nulls).
   *

   *   Implementation may be added later to export ASCII PDS tables.
