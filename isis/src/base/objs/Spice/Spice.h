   * @brief Obtain SPICE information for a spacecraft
   *
   * This class initializes standard NAIF SPICE kernels in order to allow queries
   * of a spacecraft's position and attitude at a given time. It also allows for
   * access to the position of the sun and transformation matrices from J2000 to a
   * body-fixed reference frame for a given target (e.g., Mars). The constructor
   * for this class expects a PVL object with the following minimum information:
   *   @code
   *     Group = Instrument
   *       TargetName = Mars
   *     EndGroup
   *     Group = Kernels
   *       NaifFrameCode       = -94030
   *       LeapSecond          = naif0007.tls
   *       TargetAttitudeShape = pck00006.tpc
   *       TargetPosition      = de405.bsp
   *       InstrumentPointing  = (mgs_sc_ab1.bc,
   *       Instrument          = moc13.ti
   *       SpacecraftClock     = MGS_SCLKSCET.00045.tsc
   *       InstrumentPosition  = mgs_ab1.bsp
   *       InstrumentAddendum  = mocAddendum.ti
   *     EndGroup
   *   @endcode
   * This group is typically found in the image labels after it has been run
   * through the program "spiceinit" It is recommended you read NAIF documentation
   * to obtain a better understanding about the various types of SPICE kernels.
   * The NAIF toolkit accesses information from kernels on a
   * last-in-first-out (LIFO) basis. This means that the creation of a second
   * object can cause problems with the first object. To alleviate this problem we
   * have supplied the CreateCache method which should be invoked immediately
   * after the object is constructed. This caches information (spacecraft
   * position, pointing, etc) internally in the object and unloads all NAIF
   * kernels.

   *                           so that the correct frame will be used. If the
   *                           frame is different from the default IAU frame,
   *                           the correct frame should be set in the iak file
   *                           (see frames.req).  Also modified setting of

   *                           the IAU_ frame.  The new code uses the Naif
   *                           routine cidfrm to get the frame associated with
   *                           the body id.  These change will recognize any

   *                           value, due to change made to spiceinit to retain

   *                           scope.
   *   @history 2010-01-29 Debbie A. Cook - Redid Tracie's change to make sure
   *                           the table is loaded instead of the kernels if the
   *                           kernel keyword value lists "Table" before the
   *                           kernel files.
   *   @history 2010-03-19 Debbie A. Cook - Added constructor and moved common

   *   @history 2011-02-08 Jeannie Walldren - Added documentation to methods and

   *                           this method is not needed. Initialize pointers to
   *                           NULL in Init() method.
   *   @history 2011-02-09 Steven Lambright - Refactored to use iTime where
   *                           possible. Changed p_radii to a Distance so the
   *                           units are no longer ambiguous. These changes were
   *                           meant for readability and reducing the likelyhood

   *                           furnished. This makes the Camera instantiation
   *                           much, much quicker. Text kernels are no longer
   *                           furnished when their data has been stored in the
   *                           labels.
   *   @history 2011-05-26 Debbie A. Cook - Put back the code for spkwriter
   *                           that was checked in May 25 but disappeared in the
   *                           May 26 build.  This code turns aberration
   *                           corrections off for the instrument position if
   *                           the spk file was created by spkwriter.
   *   @history 2011-07-08 Jeff Anderson - Fixed Init method to record the
   *                           integer body frame code in the labels of the
   *                           cube. Vesta exposed this problem because it was
   *                           not a instrinsic body in the NAIF toolkit
   *                           version 63.
   *   @history 2011-07-11 Jeff Anderson - Added private copy constructors and
   *                           operator= methods
   *   @history 2011-09-19 Debbie Cook - Added cubes with Ideal Cameras to the
   *                           exclusion list for reading instrument keywords
   *                           from the label.  The Ideal Camera has variable
   *                           values for the affine coefficients that are set
   *                           in the camera itself and not read from a kernel.
   *                           The camera puts these values into the Naif kernel
   *                           pool.
   *   @history 2012-07-06 Debbie A. Cook, Updated Spice members to be more

   *                           Improved unitTest coverage in all areas. New

   *                           Improved padding around control statements  and

   *                           compliant with standards. Moved accessor method

   *                           NULL. Also added isTimeSet(), a function that will return true if
   *                           m_et is set. References #4476.
   *   @history 2016-10-21 Jeannie Backer - Reorder method signatures and member variable
   *                           declarations to fit ISIS coding standards. References #4476.
   *   @history 2018-06-07 Debbie A Cook - Added BODY_CODE to Naif keywords.  This code
   *                           is used in the target body radii keyword name.  Isis retrieves this code
   *                           from the standard PCK.  Because target bodies new to Naif are not
   *                           included in the standard PCK, missions create a special body-specific
   *                           PCK to define the new body, including its body code.  This PCK is only
   *                           loaded in spiceinit so the code needs to be saved so that the radii
   *                           keyword can be created to retrieve the target radii.
   *  @history 2019-04-16 Kristin Berry - Added a parameter to getClockTime called clockTicks which
   *                           defaults to false. When set to true, this indicates that the input value
   *                           is in encoded clock ticks, rather than a full spacecraft clock time
   *                           string. As such, when used sct2e_c is used to convert to an ET rather
   *                           than scs2e_c.
   *  @history 2021-02-17 Kristin Berry, Jesse Mapel, and Stuart Sides - Made several methods virtual,
   *                           moved several member variables to protected, and added initialization
   *                           path for a sensor model without SPICE data.
