   * @internal
   *  @todo Jeff Anderson - Finish Class Documentation
   *  @history 2005-11-09 Tracie Sucharski Added HasProjection method.
   *  @history 2006-03-20 Elizabeth Miller Added camera, projection, and
   *                          Resolution methods and documentation
   *  @history 2006-03-31 Elizabeth Miller Added unitTest
   *  @history 2006-05-17 Elizabeth Miller Depricated CameraManager to
   *                          CameraFactory
   *  @history 2007-02-06 Tracie Sucharski Added SetBand method.
   *  @history 2007-02-06 Steven Lambright Fixed documentation
   *  @history 2009-04-24 Steven Koechle Added a check to SetUniversalGround that
   *       makes sure the result is on the cube before returning true.
   *  @history 2010-04-09 Sharmila Prasad Added an API to check for camera in an image
   *  @history 2010-04-28 Mackenzie Boyd Fixed dereferencing issue in constructor
   *                          that takes a cube.
   *  @history 2011-01-25 Steven Lambright Added CameraPriority and SetGround.
   *                          The CameraPriority was for grid to use projections
   *                          by default so they would work across the image
   *                          regardless of the camera. The SetGround is so that
   *                          conversions between lat/lon types are simply handled
   *                          and allows a clean interface to use the new Latitude
   *                          and Longitude classes.
   *  @history 2011-01-25 Eric Hyer - Added SetGround method for Surface Points
   *  @history 2012-03-22 Steven Lambright - Added GroundRange() method because
   *                          I needed a ground range in the qview nomenclature
   *                          tool and this seemed like the best place to put
   *                          it. The Cube paramater is optional.
   *  @history 2012-06-29 Steven Lambright and Kimberly Oyama - Made the estimation
   *                          section of GroundRange() sample more points by walking
   *                          the perimeter, the two corner to corner diagonals, and
   *                          a plus that intersects in the center of the image. This
   *                          ensures that the entire longitude range is returned.
   *                          Fixes #855.
   *  @history 2012-12-20 Debbie A. Cook - Changed to use TProjection 
   *                          instead of Projection.  References #775.
   *  @history 2013-04-24 Tracie Sucharski - Added ring plane functionality to methods
   *                          UniversalLatitude() and UniversalLongitude().  Reference #775.
   *  @history 2012-04-24 Jeannie Backer - Removed prototype for constructor that has
   *                          been removed from this class. References #775.
   *  @history 2017-06-26 Jesse Mapel - Added a new method to set the universal ground point
   *                          without adjusting for the longitude domain. Fixes #2185.
