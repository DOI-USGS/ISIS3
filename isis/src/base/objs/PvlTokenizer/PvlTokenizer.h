   * @brief Construct Token list from a stream
   *
   * This class tokenizes a stream. That is, it will take a stream, from a file
   * or a string, and break the contents of the stream into keyword-value pairs.
   * Examples of such are PDS labels, the standard Isis command line, and VICAR
   * labels. Note that this does not validate the stream to ensure it is of PDS-
   * or VICAR-type. It simply creates a list of keyword-value pairs which can be
   * parsed by another object. The ruleset for tokenizing is straightforward.
   * Consider SPACECRAFT=MARS_GLOBAL_SURVEYOR. The keyword would be SPACECRAFT
   * and the value would be MARS_GLOBAL_SURVEYOR. Other valid examples include:
   * LINES=5, FOCAL_LENGTH=12.4, INSTRUMENT="CAMERA_A", LIST=(0,1,5), and
   * DOGS=("LAB","PUG","BULL"). The later examples, are considered arrays and
   * therefore, will have multiple values associated with the keyword. Comments
   * are allowed in the stream and are indicated by either "#" or "/ *" as the
   * first character on the line.

   *  @history 2003-02-25 Stuart Sides - Modified the way END is checked for. It
   *                                     was not working for embedded labels.

   *  @history 2003-05-16 Stuart Sides - Modified schema from astrogeology...
   *                                     isis.astrogeology...

   *  @history 2003-05-28 Stuart Sides - Modified so single quotes work the same
   *                                     as double quotes
   *
   *  @history 2003-10-28 Jeff Anderson - Fixed bug in order to allow for
   *                                      whitespace inside of arrays of strings
   *
   *  @history 2004-01-22 Jeff Anderson - Removed single quotes when the occur as
   *                                      delimeters inside of array keywords.
   *
   *  @history 2005-02-16 Jeff Anderson - Modified parsing of comma separated
   *                                      lists to not remove parens or squiggly
   *                                      brackets.
   *
   *  @history 2005-02-18 Elizabeth Ribelin - Modified file to support Doxygen
   *                                          documentation
   *
   *  @history 2006-05-31 Elizabeth Miller - Fixed bug in Load method when a
   *                                         keyword is loaded without a value
   *
   *  @todo 2005-02-14 Jeff Anderson - finish class documentation and add coded
   *                                   and implementation examples
   *
   *  @history 2007-04-13 Stuart Sides - Fixed bug where quoted strings broken
   *                                     over more than two lines were not being
   *                                     read correctly.
   *
   *  @history 2009-03-13 Steven Lambright - Inline comments now correctly
   *           correlate to the keywords before them on the same line.
   *
   *  @history 2010-01-08 Eric Hyer - PvlTokenizer.cpp used EOF without including
   *                                  fstream, breaking this class on recent
   *                                  compilers (I added #include <fstream>).
