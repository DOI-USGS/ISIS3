  <brief>
    Stitches even and odd frames from push frame <def link="Cube">cubes</def> back into a single cube.
  </brief>

  <description>
    <p>
      This program combines the even and odd frames from push frame
      <def link="Cube">cubes</def> back into a single interwoven <def
      link="Cube">cube</def>. It can also optionally flip the frame
      order so that adjacent ground features appear adjacent between
      frames. If the last several rows of a frame have the same
      data as the first several rows of the next frame, reduntant
      lines can be eliminated with the num_lines_overlap parameter.
      This program is designed to be run before processing the
      data in another software package as it removes the camera
      information from the output <def link="Cube">cube</def>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When many push frame images are ingested into ISIS, their frames are separated
      into two different cubes, one with even frames and one with odd frames. In the
      odd frame cube, the lines for the even frames are Null and in the even frame cube,
      the lines for the odd frames are null. This makes processing in other applications
      difficult because each image only has half the data and covers half the ground.
      The footprint for each image is also composed of multiple disjoint pieces and can
      be difficult to work with.

            If true, the order of the frames in the output cube will be reversed.
            So the firt frame in the output cube will be the last frame in the input
            cubes and the last frame in the output cube will be the first frame in
            the input cubes.

          <p>
            This option can be used to correct for adjacent ground points not being
            adjacent between frames. This occurs when the flight direction and the
            increasing line direction on the detector are opposite each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            This option can also be used to undo any flipping in the input cubes.

          The estimated total number of lines in each frame which have
          the same pixel values as frames above and below it. During
          processing, half this amount of lines will be removed from
          each of the top and bottom of the frame. Must be an even
          non-negative number.

            If not entered, the program will assume the value 0. A value
