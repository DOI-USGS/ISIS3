    Generate NAIF compatible SPICE SPK kernels from ISIS cubes
  </brief>

  <description>
      <p>
          <b>spkwriter</b> produces NAIF compatible SPICE  SPK kernels from one 
          or more ISIS cube files.  The cube files must have been initialized 
          with the  <b>spiceinit</b>  program.  They may also have undergone
          pointing adjustments by <b>jigsaw</b> or some other (bundle) 
          adjustment application.  
      </p>
      <p>
          The contents of the SPK kernels are extracted from the ISIS 
          <i>InstrumentPosition</i> Table (BLOB) in the ISIS file. These Tables
          are created by the <b>spiceinit</b> application and its contents
          further modified by ISIS pointing (bundle) adjustments.  The contents
          may not be in a state that can be written directly to the kernel.
          They must be converted (e.g., rotated/transformed) into the proper
          reference frames utilized by each mission/instrument. These frames are
          defined uniquely in each instrument camera model. 
      </p>
      <p>
          Users may provide one or more ISIS cube files to the application.  
           Each file is written to the SPK kernel as its own segment.    The 
          <i> ProductId</i> from the ISIS label is used as the NAIF SEGMENT ID. 
           This  information, along with other information pertaining to the 
           ISIS file and image data, are recorded in the kernel comment section. 
           A general description of the SPK kernel contents is provided by the
           application but the user can provide their own comment for the kernel
           if it is not sufficient in the COMFILE parameter.    Should the user
           provide a comments file, those comments will be written to the kernel
           file in lieu of the default provided by this application.
       </p>
      <p>
          Provided in every SPK kernel file created is the complete list of all 
          the SPICE kernels, DEMs and extras loaded by          
          <b>spiceinit</b>.  In order to ensure the same geometric properties 
          when using this kernel, the same kernels listed for the ISIS file 
          segment must be supplied in any subsequent  run of
          <b>spiceinit</b>.  The <i>PolyDergree</i> is the degree of the
          polynomial used when writing each individual segment to the NAIF SPK 
          kernel.  The <i>CamVersion</i> value listed refers to the version of
          the ISIS camera model in use at the time the SPK data was created.
          Any subsequent code changes to the ISIS camera model may result in
          different geometric properties of the image.
      </p>
      <p>
          The following is an example of the contents of the comment section in 
          an output SPK kernel created by this application:

 Position Data in the File
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
       This file contains time ordered array of geometric states 
       (kilometers) and rates of change (kilometers/second) of body
       relative to center, specified relative to frame.
 
 
 Status
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
       This kernel was generated for the purposes of storing C-Smithed
       position updates that may have been generated from ISIS processing
       techniques (controlled imaging, jitter analysis, etc...).  These
       SPK kernels are intended to mimick SPKs provided by individual
       missions (or NAV teams).
 

 Pedigree
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
       This file was generated by an automated process.  The ISIS
       application spkwriter was used to read SPK kernel data
       contained within an ISIS cube file.  It then writes it as an
       individual segment in the SPK.  Hence, a list of files can be
       written to a single SPK kernel.  However, mixing the instruments
       contained in a single SPK kernel is discouraged.
 
 
 Angular Rates
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
       This kernel typically contains state vectors of rates of change
       as a function of time but may only contain position vectors.  The
       ephemeris given is for the body moving relative to the center of
       motion.
 
 
 Usage Note
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
       To make use of this file in a typical SPICE based application,
       users must supply at least a leapseconds kernel. This file is
       necessary for time-based conversions.  They should be the same
       kernels that were originally used to initialize the image.
 
       Segments in this file are actually individual ISIS files where the
       internally cached SPICE data is extracted and transformed into the
       appropriate content to satisfy NAIF's SPICE kernel storage
       requirements.  The contents of this kernel are summarized below.
 

 Segment (by file) Summary
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
       The follow sections describe each segment in this SPK kernel.  Each
       segment is a file in the input list.  When running ISIS spiceinit,
       the kernels listed for each file should be supplied to ensure proper
       geometry can be reproduced accurately.

      <p>
          Contents of the comment section in the SPK kernel can be replaced by 
          the user if desired.  The individual file segment information will 
          always be written to the label.
      </p>
      <p>
          To extract the contents of the SPICE SPK kernel it is recommended you 
          use the SPICE   <b>commnt</b> utility.  The form of the command to
          extract the contents is <b>commnt -r PSP_001446_1790_RED2_0.bc</b>.
          This SPICE utility can be downloaded from NAIF's web site from one of
          the supported systems at the location
          ftp://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/utilities.
      </p>
      <p>
          The SUMMARY parameter is provided as a file name that will contain the 
          comments section of the output SPK kernel file.   This can be used in 
          addition to or in lieu of the TO parameter.  Getting the contents of 
          the comment section of the NAIF SPK SPICE kernel in the TO file 
          requires the NAIF utility program,  <b>commnt</b> . 
      </p>
      <p>
          To use the newly created SPK SPICE kernel in the ISIS environment, you 
          use the <b>spiceinit</b> program providing, at a minimum, the SPK 
          kernel created by <b>spkwriter</b> in the <i>SPK</i> parameter. The
          basic command would be:
          <br/> <br/>
          <b>spiceinit from=PSP_001446_1790_RED2_0.cub 
              SPK=PSP_001446_1790_RED2_0.bsp</b>
          <br/>
           <br/>
          This would be the best case scenario should all the other kernels 
          listed in the comments be selected.  If they are not the same, then 
          you will need to resort to explicitly providing all of them in the 
          <b>spiceinit</b> command line.  Here is the command using the above 
          list for PSP_001446_1790_RED2_0:<br/>
          <br/>
          <b>
              spiceinit from=PSP_001446_1790_RED2_0.cub<br/> 
                LS='$base/kernels/lsk/naif0009.tls'<br/>
                PCK='$base/kernels/pck/pck00009.tpc'<br/>
                TSPK='$base/kernels/spk/de405.bsp'<br/> 
                IK='$mro/kernels/ik/mro_hirise_v11.ti'<br/>
                SCLK='$mro/kernels/sclk/MRO_SCLKSCET.00041.65536.tsc'<br/>
                CK=PSP_001446_1790_RED2_0.bc<br/>
                FK='$mro/kernels/fk/mro_v14.tf'<br/>
                SPK='$mro/kernels/spk/mro_psp1.bsp'<br/>
                IAK='$mro/kernels/iak/hiriseAddendum006.ti'<br/>
                SHAPE=USER<br/>
                MODEL='$base/dems/molaMarsPlanetaryRadius0004.cub'<br/>
          </b>
      </p>
       <p>
          The other important thing to note is that when you provide explicit 
          filenames in <b>spiceinit</b> parameters, you typically will be 
          <i>required</i> to give the full path the file.  If you do not do 
          this, then camera models cannot properly initialize because it will 
          always look for the file in the current directory.  An example 
          command should be  <b>spiceinit from=viking.cub 
          EXTRA=$PWD/viking.bsp</b> 
       </p>

              <description>
                  SPKTYPE allows the user to specify which type of kernel to 
                  create.  Valid values are 1 to 18 for SPK kernels. However, at 
                  this time, only a limited number of the available types are 
                  supported.  The primary reason we do not support other types 
                  is that many of the other types do not apply to ISIS cube 
                  epheremis. Please see the
