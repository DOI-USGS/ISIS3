  /**
   * @brief GisOverlapStrategy determines Resources that share common geometry 
   *  
   * This class takes a Resource list and determines other Resources that 
   * contain GIS geometries and computes overlaps. Resources that have overlaps 
   * will have composite Resources created from the merged result of the 
   * overlaping pairs that result in a new Resource added to the named asset. 
   *  
   * This is a potentially useful Strategy for other Strategies that may decide
   * to inherit this class. Therefore, it contains several useful virtual 
   * methods that can be reimplemented by the inheriting class. See 
   * processOverlaps() and processOverlap().
