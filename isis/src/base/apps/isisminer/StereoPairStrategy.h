  /**
   * @brief StereoPairStrategy Compute stereo pair parameters from Resources 
   *  
   * This Strategy object computes stereo compliments of a a given image but 
   * using the GisOverlapStrategy to determine which geometry provides the 
   * appropriate overlap defined by constraints. 
   *  
   * Once all overlaps have been defined, they are recorded in a parameter named 
   * by the AssetName keyword (Default: GisOverlap). See the GisOverlap strategy 
   * definition for keywords in that strategy that will also apply to 
   * specification and use of this strategy. 
   *  
   * By using the GisOverlapStrategy as a base class we are able to take 
   * advantage of the virtual methods of that class, overlapCandidates() and 
   * processOverlap(), which are reimplemented in this class for extended 
   * functionality. 
   *  
   * overlapCandidates() method is used to appy the level 1 stereo candidate 
   * screening parameters such as resolution and phase, emission and incidence 
   * angle constraints. 
   *  
   * The provision of merging the overlapping pairs provided by the GisOverlap 
   * strategy is utilized here but stereo computations are performed on the two 
   * distinct Resources so keyword maps should specify keywords in that domain 
   * and not the mereged one. 
   *  
   * This strategy will take the list of all overlaping geometries and apply 
   * named keywords that are required to compute the stereo aspects of the 
   * overlaping geometries. This necessary keywords that typically satisfy the 
   * keyword requirements are provided by runs of caminfo.  
   *  
   * processOverlap() computes the stereo strength parameters 
   * ThresholdConstraintsRankA, ThresholdConstraintsRankB, 
   * ThresholdConstraintsRank (which is actually just 
   * ThresholdConstraintsRankA), ParallaxHeighRatio,  ShadowTipDistance, 
   * ResolutionRatio, DeltaSunAzimuthDifference and DeltaSPCAzimuthDifference 
   * (in degrees), VerticalPrecision and finally StereoConstraitsRank. 
   *  
   * The ranking of the total strenght of the stereo is computed using the 
   * CalculatorStrategy. It has the same construct so include the computation of 
   * a stereo index ranking using any of the composite image A or B merged 
   * keywords or ones created by this Strategy.
