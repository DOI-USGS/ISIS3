# This isisminer CONFIG file determines image overlaps for all MDIS images.
# The complete set of MESSENGER MDIS image data is contained in two
# separate databases. This set of Strategies reads from two different
# databases created from footprintinit/caminfo data and determines the stereo
# compliments for every image in the defined Region. Region definitions
# should be used to restrict the range of images using database
# CenterLatitude/CenterLongitude and the corners of the Region definition in
# the GLOBALS file parameter.
