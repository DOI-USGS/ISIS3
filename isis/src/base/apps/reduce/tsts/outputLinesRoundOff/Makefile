# This particular test is testing the calulation of scale and output line and sample.  This is a 
# result of a sporadic bug that was found (Mantis #1385) which only occurs at certain scales and
# user selected output number of lines.  For certain ONL values, the scale was calculated in
# the reduce application and passed into the Reduce object, which then calculated the ONL/ONS.  For
# certain scales there would be a round off error and the ONL/ONS would be 1 greater than what the
# user had entered.
