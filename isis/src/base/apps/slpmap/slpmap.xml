  <brief>
    Create slope, aspect, or percent slope data cube.
  </brief>

  <description>
    This program creates a new cube containing slope (radians, degree,s or percent) or aspect
    (radians, degrees) data from an input cube. This program computes the slope and aspect of
    an input cube and outputs the results. An individual slope, aspec, or percent slope cube can
    be rendered using this program.

    <p>Data requirements to run slpmap:
      <ul>
        <li> A digital terrain model (DTM) with DN values representing the radius or elevation of a
             target body, or </li>
        <li> Any ISIS cube that is a level 1 or level 2 image (can be multiband).</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    Horne's algorithm is used to compute the slope or aspect. A 3x3 kernel:
    <pre>
      A  B  C
      D  E  F
      G  H  I
    </pre>

    Each output pixel is computed as follows:
    
    <pre>
      <b>SLOPE EQUATION</b>
      [dz/dx] = ((C + 2F + I) - (A + 2D + G)) / (8 * X_PIXEL_RESOLUTION)
      [dz/dy] = ((G + 2H + I) - (A + 2B + C)) / (8 * Y_PIXEL_RESOLUTION)

      slope = ATAN ( SQRT ( [dz/dx]^2 + [dz/dy]^2 ) )
      percentslope = slope / 90
    </pre>

    The slope equation above assumes the pixels are not square: hence X_PIXEL_RESOLUTION and
    Y_PIXEL_RESOLUTION. That is, the x distance across the pixel is not equal to the y distance
    form top to bottom of the pixel.
    
    <pre>
      <b>ASPECT EQUATION</b>
      [dz/dx] = ((C + 2F + I) - (A + 2D + G)) / 8
      [dz/dy] = ((G + 2H + I) - (A + 2B + C)) / 8

      aspect = 90 - ATAN2 ([dz/dy], -[dz/dx])
      if (aspect &lt; 0) then aspect = aspect + 360
    </pre>

    <p><b>Slope:</b>
      Slope is typically between 0 and 90 degrees, were 0 is flat and 90 is vertical.Slope may be
      output in radians, degrees, or percent slope.
    </p>

    <p><b>Aspect:</b>
    The aspect represents the direction or 0 to 360 degrees of the slope in pixel space (see
    figure below). From the center pixel (E), 0 degrees is straight towards B (generally north),
    45 is towards C, 90 is towards F, 135 is towards I, 180 is towards H, and so on.

    <pre><b>
      A  B  C
      D  E  F
      G  H  I
    </b></pre>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>Scale Construction:</b>
      By default, the program will attempt to remove any scaling differences by using the map
      projection information (PIXRES=AUTOMATIC). This computation is done at every pixel so the
      correct x-to-y ratio is computed. This is important, for example, for global maps where
      the x/y ratio deviates with distance from the latitude and/or longitude of true scale in
      a map projection. This only works for radius DTMs.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>What if the input cube Z units are in elevation values instead of radius values?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The default setting PIXRES=AUTOMATIC will not work. You will need to set PIXRES=FILE
      (recommended for a map projected file) or  PIXRES=USER. Note: unlike PIXRES=AUTOMATIC,
      these later two methods do not correct for distortions int he map projection. They will
      return good results for smaller regious when the map projection is defined to minimixe
      distortions (e.g. LROC NAC or HIRISE sereo DTMs).
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>What if the input cube is not map projected?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      If the image lacks a map projection,you must provide the pixel resolution via PIXRES=USER
      (for this option the pixels are assumed to be square). You must also provide a single value
      using the RESOLUTION parameter that will be applied to all pixels in the image and in both
      directions.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>What if the xy units are not the same as the z units?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The program assumes the xy units are the same as the z (pixel) units. By default
      the program assumes the units are the same, but allows you to scale the z units to the xy
      units using the CONVERSIONFACTOR parameter if the PIXRES=USER option is selected.

    <change name="Jeff Anderson" date="2012-08-02">
      Changed the slope algorithm to compute the sample and line resolution
      at each pixel.  Previously the algorithm used the resolution at the
      center of the image. In projected images the resolution varies as you
      move away from the latitude and/or longitude of true scale.   Also, improved the
      documentation and added user options to output percent slope.

      Backward Compatibility Issue: Changed the default output to be slope rather than percent
      slope.
      Backward Compatibility Issue: Removed ability to supply a conversion factor when using
      the automatic resolution option (CONVERSION=AUTOMATIC). AUTOMATIC, assumes the DNs in 
      the cube have units of meters.
      Added a test to the CONVERSION=AUTOMATIC option so DNs in the cube with negative values
      will cause a better error to be shown. Added a BANDBIN group to the output cube labels.

    <change name="Kimberly Oyama" date="2014-03-28">
      Added the FILE option to the PIXRES parameter. This allows the user to specify that the
      pixel resolution from the input cube's projection should be used. Updated the documentation.

        <description>
          This parameter is a multiplicative factor for the resolution. It is used to convert the
          spatial units (pixels) to the correct distance units. Since the slope algorithm depends
          on cancelling out the units, the conversion factor from the z vertical (input pixel)
          units to the xy horizontal (spatial) units needs to be considered.

          For example, if the xy units are in meters and the z units are in kilometers the unit
          conversion factor should be 1000 as we are converting z kilometers to xy meters.

          The default presumes the units are the same.
