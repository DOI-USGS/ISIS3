    Generate NAIF compatible SPICE CK kernels from ISIS cubes
  </brief>

  <description>
      <p>
          <b>ckwriter</b> produces a NAIF compatible SPICE CK kernel from one or 
          more ISIS cube files.  The cube files must have been initialized with 
          the <b>spiceinit</b>  program.  They may also have undergone pointing 
          adjustments by <b>jigsaw</b> or some other (bundle) adjustment 
          application.  
      </p>
      <p>
          The contents of the CK kernel are extracted from the ISIS 
          <i>InstrumentRotation</i> Table (BLOB) in the ISIS file.  This Table 
          is created by the  <b>spiceinit</b> application and its contents 
          further modified by ISIS pointing (bundle) adjustments.  The contents 
          may not be in a state that can be written directly to the kernel.  They 
          must be converted (i.e., rotated) into the proper reference frames 
          utilized by each mission/instrument.  These frames are specified in 
          the ISIS specific instrument addendum kernels (IAK).  For example, the 
          HiRISE instrument addendum kernel is 
          $ISIS3DATA/mro/kernels/iak/hiriseAddendum006.ti.  The keyword ending 
          in <i>CK_FRAME_ID</i> is the instrument frame stored in the CK kernel.  
          The  keyword ending in <i>CK_REFERENCE_ID</i> is the CK reference 
          frame.  These frames will vary from mission to mission.
      </p>
      <p>
          Users may provide one or more ISIS cube files to the application.  
           Each file is written to the CK kernel as its own segment.    The 
          <i> ProductId</i> from the ISIS label is used as the NAIF SEGMENT ID. 
           This  information  along with other information pertaining to the 
           ISIS file and image data is recorded in the kernel comment section.   
           A general description of the CK kernel contents is provided by the 
           application but the user can provide their own comment for the kernel 
           if it is not sufficient in the COMFILE parameter.
       </p>
      <p>
          Provided in every CK kernel file created is the complete list of all 
          the SPICE kernels, DEMs and extras loaded by                
          <b>spiceinit</b>.  In order to ensure the same geometric properties 
          when using this kernel, the same kernels listed for the ISIS file 
          segment must be supplied in any subsequent  run of
          <b>spiceinit</b>.  The <i>CamVersion</i> value listed refers to the 
          version of the ISIS camera model in use at the time the CK data was 
          created.  Any subsequent code changes to the ISIS camera model may 
          result in different geometric properties of the image.
      </p>

          The following is an example of the contents of the comment section in 
          the resulting CK kernel:

  USGS ISIS (ckwriter) Generated CK Kernel
  Created By:   kbecker

****************************************************************************
 
Orientation Data in the File
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
      This file contains orientation and potentially derived angular
      rates (where possible/specified).
 
 
Status
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
      This kernel was generated for the purpose of storing C-Smithed
      pointing updates generated through ISIS processing techniques
      (control nets, jitter analysis, etc...).  These CK kernels
      are intended to mimick CKs provided by individual mission
      (NAV teams).
 
Pedigree
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
      This file was generated by an automated process.  The ISIS
      application ckwriter was used to read CK kernel data
      contained within an ISIS cube file.  It then writes it as an
      individual segment in the CK.  Hence, a list of files can be
      written to a single CK kernel.  However, mixing the instruments
      contained in a single CK kernel is discouraged.
 
      Individual segments coming from files will have a single record
      written for the center of the exposure (time) for framing
      instruments or a record/image line for line scan instruments.
 
      Creating type 3 CK kernels must contain at least 3 records for
      framing instruments to avoid roundoff error for the center of the
      exposure time of an image.  Framing instruments should pad time
      using the spiceinit application options.
 
 
Angular Rates
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
      This kernel may or may not contain angular velocity vectors. Efforts
      are made to preserve and provide angular velocities where they
      originally existed.
 
 
Usage Note
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
      To make use of this file in a typical SPICE based application,
      you must supply a leapseconds kernel, a mission spacecraft clock
      kernel, and the instrument/spacecraft frame kernel.  These files
      provide the supporting ancillary data to properly query this
      C-kernel for attitude content.  They should be the same kernels that
      were originally used to initialize the image.
 
      Segments in this file are actually individual ISIS files where the
      internally cached SPICE data is extracted and transformed into the
      appropriate content to satisfy NAIF's SPICE kernel storage
      requirements.  The contents of this kernel are summarized below.
 
Segment (by file) Summary
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
      The follow sections describe each segment in this CK kernel.  Each
      segment is a file in the input list.  When running ISIS spiceinit,
      the kernels listed for each file should be supplied to ensure proper
      geometry can be reproduced accurately.

      <p>
          Contents of the comment section in the CK kernel can be replaced by 
          the user if desired.  The individual file segment information will 
          always be written to the label.
      </p>
      <p>
          To extract the contents of the SPICE CK kernel it is recommended you 
          use the SPICE <b>commnt</b> utility.  The form of the command to 
          extract the contents is <b>commnt -r PSP_001446_1790_RED2_0.bc</b>. 
          This SPICE utility can be downloaded from NAIF's web site from one of 
          the supported systems at the location 
          ftp://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/utilities.
      </p>
      <p>
          The SUMMARY parameter is provided as a file name that will contain the 
          comments section of the output CK kernel file.   This can be used in 
          addition to or in lieu of the TO parameter.  Getting the contents of 
          the comment section of the NAIF CK SPICE kernel in the TO file 
          requires the NAIF utility program, <b>commnt</b> . 
      </p>
      <p>
          To use the newly created CK SPICE kernel in the ISIS environment, you 
          use the <b>spiceinit</b> program providing, at a minimum, the CK 
          kernel created by <b>ckwriter</b> in the <i>CK</i> parameter.  The 
          basic command would be:<br/>
          <br/>
          <b>spiceinit from=PSP_001446_1790_RED2_0.cub 
              CK=PSP_001446_1790_RED2_0.bc</b>
          <br/>
           <br/>
          This would be the best case scenario should all the other kernels 
          listed in the comments be selected.  If they are not the same, then 
          you will need to resort to explicitly providing all of them in the 
          <b>spiceinit</b> command line.  Here is the command using the above 
          list for PSP_001446_1790_RED2_0:<br/>
          <br/>
          <b>
              spiceinit from=PSP_001446_1790_RED2_0.cub<br/>
