    Generate NAIF compatible SPICE CK kernels from ISIS cubes
  </brief>

  <description>
      <p>
          <b>ckwriter</b> produces a NAIF compatible SPICE CK kernel from one or 
          more ISIS cube files.  The cube files must have been initialized with 
          the <b>spiceinit</b>  program.  They may also have undergone pointing 
          adjustments by <b>jigsaw</b> or some other (bundle) adjustment 
          application but this is not required.  
      </p>
      <p>
          The contents of the CK kernel are extracted from the ISIS 
          <i>InstrumentRotation</i> Table (BLOB) in the ISIS file.  This table 
          is created by the  <b>spiceinit</b> application and its contents 
          further modified by ISIS pointing (bundle) adjustments.  The contents 
          may not be in a state that can be written directly to the kernel.  They 
          must be converted (i.e., rotated) into the proper reference frames 
          utilized by each mission/instrument.  These frames are specified in 
          each ISIS instrument-specific camera model implementation and will 
          vary from mission to mission.
      </p>
      <p>
          Users may provide one or more ISIS cube files to the application.  
           Each file is written to the CK kernel as its own segment. The  
           <i>ProductId</i> from the ISIS label is used as the NAIF SEGMENT ID. 
           This information along with other information pertaining to the ISIS 
           file and image data is recorded in the kernel comment section. A 
           general description of the CK kernel contents is provided by the 
           application but the user can provide their own comment for the kernel 
           if it is not sufficient in the COMFILE parameter.
       </p>
       <p>
            Each image is checked for overlap in start/end time ranges.  Any 
            files that have common time coverages are identified and reported. 
            Furthermore, the user may select with the OVERLAP parameter how to 
            treat occurances of overlapping time ranges. It seems highly likely 
            that images with common time coverage is a conflict and an error 
            should be generated and the output CK kernel is not created. 
            However, if the user chooses, they can be treated as warnings and 
            the TO output CK kernel will be generated in this case.  It is up to 
            the user to determine if this is intended/valid behavior. 
       </p>
      <p>
          Provided in every CK kernel file created is the complete list of all 
          the SPICE kernels, DEMs and extras loaded by          
          <b>spiceinit</b>.  In order to ensure the same geometric properties 
          when using this kernel, the same kernels listed for the ISIS file 
          segment must be supplied in any subsequent run of
          <b>spiceinit</b>.  The <i>CamVersion</i> value listed refers to the 
          version of the ISIS camera model in use at the time the CK data was 
          created.  Any subsequent code changes to the ISIS camera model may 
          result in different geometric properties of the image.
      </p>

          The following is an example of the contents of the comment section in 
          the resulting CK kernel:

  USGS ISIS (ckwriter) Generated CK Kernel

Orientation Data in the File
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
      This file contains orientation and potentially derived angular
      rates (where possible/specified).
 
 
Status
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
      This kernel was generated for the purpose of storing C-Smithed
      pointing updates generated through ISIS processing techniques
      (control nets, jitter analysis, etc...).  These CK kernels
      are intended to mimick CKs provided by individual mission
      (NAV teams).
 
Pedigree
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
      This file was generated by an automated process.  The ISIS
      application <b>ckwriter</b> was used to read CK kernel data
      contained within an ISIS cube file.  It then writes it as an
      individual segment in the CK.  Hence, a list of files can be
      written to a single CK kernel.  However, mixing the instruments
      contained in a single CK kernel is discouraged.
 
      Individual segments coming from files will have a single record
      written for the center of the exposure (time) for framing
      instruments or a record/image line for line scan instruments.
 
      Creating type 3 CK kernels must contain at least 3 records for
      framing instruments to avoid roundoff error for the center of the
      exposure time of an image.  Framing instruments should pad time
      using the spiceinit application options.
 
 
Angular Rates
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
      This kernel may or may not contain angular velocity vectors. Efforts
      are made to preserve and provide angular velocities where they
      originally existed.
 
 
Usage Note
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
      To make use of this file in a typical SPICE based application,
      you must supply a leapseconds kernel, a mission spacecraft clock
      kernel, and the instrument/spacecraft frame kernel.  These files
      provide the supporting ancillary data to properly query this
      C-kernel for attitude content.  They should be the same kernels that
      were originally used to initialize the image.
 
      Segments in this file are actually individual ISIS files where the
      internally cached SPICE data is extracted and transformed into the
      appropriate content to satisfy NAIF's SPICE kernel storage
      requirements.  The contents of this kernel are summarized below.

User Comments
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
      NONE
 
Segment (by file) Summary
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
      The follow sections describe each segment in this CK kernel.  Each
      segment is a file in the input list.  When running ISIS spiceinit,
      the kernels listed for each file should be supplied to ensure proper
      geometry can be reproduced accurately.

          Contents of the comment section in the CK kernel may include comments 
          provided by the user in a file specified by the COMFILE parameter if 
          desired.
      </p>
      <p>
          To extract the contents of the SPICE CK kernel it is recommended you 
          use the SPICE <b>commnt</b> utility.  The form of the command to 
          extract the contents is <b>commnt -r PSP_001446_1790_RED2_0.bc</b>. 
          This SPICE utility can be downloaded from NAIF's web site from one of 
          the supported systems at the location 
          <a href="ftp://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/utilities">ftp://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/utilities</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
          The SUMMARY parameter is provided as a file name that will contain the 
          comments section of the output CK kernel file.   This can be used in 
          addition to or in lieu of the TO parameter.  Getting the contents of 
          the comment section of the NAIF CK SPICE kernel in the TO file 
          requires the NAIF utility program, <b>commnt</b>. 
      </p>
      <p>
          To use the newly created CK SPICE kernel in the ISIS environment, you 
          use the <b>spiceinit</b> program providing, at a minimum, the CK 
          kernel created by <b>ckwriter</b> in the <i>CK</i> parameter.  The 
          basic command would be:<br/>
          <br/>
          <b>spiceinit from=PSP_001446_1790_RED2_0.cub 
              CK=PSP_001446_1790_RED2_0.bc</b>
          <br/>
           <br/>
          This would be the best case scenario should all the other kernels 
          listed in the comments be selected.  If they are not the same, then 
          you will need to resort to explicitly providing all of them in the 
          <b>spiceinit</b> command line.  Here is the command using the above 
          list for PSP_001446_1790_RED2_0:<br/>
          <br/>
          <b>
              spiceinit from=PSP_001446_1790_RED2_0.cub \<br/>

          </b>
      </p>
      <p>
         The above HiRISE <b>spiceinit</b> example is not representative of 
         how every mission instrument would use the CK kernels produced by 
        <b>ckwriter</b>.  MESSENGER MDIS is one known variation.
      </p>
    <p>
        MESSENGER has three differnet CK kernels that are used in 
      <b>spiceinit</b> . The somewhat complex nature of how these kernels are 
        determined when <b>spiceinit</b> is run is hidden from the user in the 
        kernel database backend.  The CK kernel produced by <b>ckwriter</b> 
        replaces two of these kernels (attitude history and daily kernels).  The 
        pivot kernel is still required in addition to the kernel produced by 
        <b>ckwriter</b>.  This requires special consideration when running 
        spiceint using these kernels.
    </p>
    <p>
        MESSENGER MDIS pivot kernels are of the form 
        MMMMMMMMMM_CCCCCC_mdis_pivot_pvtres.bc where the "M"s are numerical
        representations of mission elasped time (MET) and the "C"s are the 
        number of images covered in the pivot kernel.  It is sufficient to 
        select the latest version of the pivot kernel (as it is for all   
        MESSENGER kernels except daily CKs) as new entries are added to previous 
        versions and redistributed by the MESSENGER team.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is a T/C shell example showing how to apply a CK kernel produced by 
        <b>ckwriter</b> on MESSENGER MDIS images that are covered in the kernel:
      <PRE><b>
ckwriter from=EN0131771668M.cub to=EN0131771668M.bc
set extra = ls -1t $ISISDATA/messenger/kernels/ck/*_mdis_pivot_pvtres.bc | head -1
spiceinit from=EN0131771668M.cub ck=EN0131771668M.bc extra=$extra        
        </b></PRE>   
        Note that this form of the <b>spiceinit</b> command can only be used on 
        <b>ckwriter</b> kernels.  The normal form must be used on images that do 
        not contain coverage in the <b>ckwriter</b> produced kernels (unless 
        they are formally incorporated into ISIS as a "smithed" kernel set). 
    </p>
      <p>

          more information.

        <description>
          This file contains a list of ISIS cubes that will be used to generate 
          SPICE kernels from.  Each file is expected to be a level 0 image that 
          has at least had <b>spiceinit</b> run on it.  The relevant SPICE 
          quaternions are extracted from each file, translated to appropriate 
          coordinates compatible with established mission criteria and written 
          to the specified SPICE kernel file.

          WARNING- Data from missions with multiple cameras imaging
          concurrently or have images separated into even/odd image lines (e.g., 
          LROC WAC) should not be put into the same kernel unless the concurrent 
          images were treated as a single observation in the bundle adjustment.  
          For instance, a left and right camera imaging concurrently could be 
          considered to be a single observation.  If these images are not 
          treated as a single observation in the bundle adjustment, they will
          likely have different orientation for the same time
          coverage.  In this case, two runs of <b>ckwriter</b> would be
          necessary:  one run using only left images and the other
          run using only right images.
