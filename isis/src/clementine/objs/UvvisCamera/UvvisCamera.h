   *   @history 2007-01-11 Tracie Sucharski - Original version.
   *   @history 2007-01-30 Elizabeth Ribelin - Renamed String to QString and
   *                           Time to iTime.
   *   @history 2007-07-10 Steven Lambright - Added unitTest.  Read boresight
   *                           from addendum.  Added time to 1/2 exposure
   *                           duration to get center time of image.
   *   @history 2007-07-11 Steven Koechle - Casted NaifIkCode to int before
   *                           istring to fix Linux 32bit build error
   *   @history 2008-08-08 Steven Lambright - Made the unit test work with a
   *                           Sensor change. Also, now using the new
   *                           LoadCache(...) method instead of CreateCache(...).
   *   @history 2009-08-28 Steven Lambright - Changed inheritance to no longer
   *                           inherit directly from Camera.  Camera is now pure
   *                           virtual, parent class is FramingCamera.
   *   @history 2010-09-16 Steven Lambright - Updated unitTest to not use a DEM.
   *   @history 2011-01-14 Travis Addair - Added new CK/SPK accessor methods,
   *                           pure virtual in Camera, implemented in mission
   *                           specific cameras.
   *   @history 2011-02-09 Steven Lambright - Major changes to camera classes.
   *   @history 2011-05-03 Jeannie Walldren - Added ShutterOpenCloseTimes()
   *                           method. Updated unitTest to test for new methods.
   *                           Updated documentation. Replaced Clementine
   *                           namespace wrap with Isis namespace. Added Isis
   *                           Disclaimer to files. Added NAIF error check to
   *                           constructor.
   *   @history 2012-07-06 Debbie A. Cook, Updated Spice members to be more compliant with Isis 
   *                           coding standards. References #972.
   *   @history 2015-08-12 Ian Humphrey and Makayla Shepherd - Added new data members and methods
   *                           to get spacecraft and instrument names. Extended unit test to test
   *                           these methods.
   *   @history 2015-10-16 Ian Humphrey - Removed declarations of spacecraft and instrument 
   *                           members and methods and removed implementation of these methods
   *                           since Camera now handles this. References #2335.
   *   @history 2017-12-27 Jeff Anderson & Victor Silva - Added instrument specific distortion
   *                           model for Clementine UVVIS.
   *   @history 2018-09-01 Jeannie Backer - Added documentation, brought closer to coding
   *            standards and merged into public repo.
