   * @brief KernelDb class
   *
   * This class handles kernel database files.  Once the database files have been
   * loaded into a Pvl, the highest version of each kernel can be found by
   * calling methods with corresponding kernel names, as shown below.
   *
   * <code>
   * KernelDb baseKernels(0);
   *
   * baseKernels.loadSystemDb(mission, lab);
   *
   * Kernel lk, pck, targetSpk, fk, ik, sclk, spk, iak, dem, exk;
   * priority_queue< Kernel > ck;
   * lk        = baseKernels.leapSecond(lab);
   * pck       = baseKernels.targetAttitudeShape(lab);
   * targetSpk = baseKernels.targetPosition(lab);
   * ik        = baseKernels.instrument(lab);
   * sclk      = baseKernels.spacecraftClock(lab);
   * iak       = baseKernels.instrumentAddendum(lab);
   * fk        = ckKernels.frame(lab);
   * ck        = ckKernels.spacecraftPointing(lab);
   * spk       = spkKernels.spacecraftPosition(lab);

   *                           files and fixed a bug in SearchMatch.
   *   @history 2007-07-09 Steven Lambright - Removed inheritance from PVL
   *   @history 2007-10-25 Steven Koechle - Corrected Smithed Enum
   *                           fixed search methods.
   *   @history 2007-07-09 Steven Lambright - Added Kernel class and multiple-ck
   *                           return
   *   @history 2009-05-12 Steven Lambright - Added Camera Version Checking
   *   @history 2010-07-19 Steven Lambright - Added kernel selection merging
   *   @history 2011-10-05 Jacob Danton - The placement of int cameraVersion =
   *                           CameraFactory::CameraVersion(lab); was the reason
   *                           that spiceinit ran so slowly. Its placement in the
   *                           "Matches" function resulted in CameraFactory
   *                           reading in the "Camera.plugin" file for every
   *                           single kernel in both the CK and SPK
   *                           kernels.????.db files. That means, for LRO, it was
   *                           read in around 2100 times. By moving this line of
   *                           code out of the "Matches" function and into the
   *                           "FindAll" function (the only one that calls
   *                           "Matches") and then passing it as a parameter, I
   *                           was able to reduce the time to about 5% (from
   *                           almost 4 minutes to under 15 seconds).
   *   @history 2013-02-26 Jeannie Backer - Modified loadSystemDb() to check
   *                           kernel directories first for config files that are
   *                           mission specific and/or point to multiple db
   *                           files. If the config files do not exist, then the
   *                           newest db file from that kernel directory is read.
   *                           Added m_kernelDbFiles, kernelDbFiles(), and
   *                           readKernelDbFiles(). Moved Kernel class from the
   *                           KernelDb header file into it's own directory.
   *                           Moved the KernelType enumeration from a global
   *                           "spiceInit" namespace in this header file into the
   *                           Kernel class and renamed it Type. Changed method
   *                           names to lower camel case and changed member
   *                           variable prefix to m_ to comply with Isis3
   *                           standards. Documented methods, member variables.
   *                           Added cases to unitTest.Fixes #924.
   *   @history 2013-02-27 Steven Lambright - This class no longer requires the Instrument group (or
   *                           camera version information) to be present in order to enumerate
   *                           kernels. This was done so that the 'shadow' program could find a
   *                           PCK and SPK to load despite not having a cube with camera
   *                           information. References #1232.
