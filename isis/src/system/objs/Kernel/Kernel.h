   *   @history 2013-02-26 Jeannie Backer - Moved this class from the KernelDb
   *                           header file into it's own directory.  Moved
   *                           method implementation into a cpp file. Moved the
   *                           KernelType enumeration from a global "spiceInit"
   *                           namespace into the Kernel class and renamed it
   *                           Type. Added accessor and mutator methods. Changed
   *                           method names to lower camel case and changed
   *                           member variable prefix to m_ to comply with Isis
   *                           standards. Documented enumeration, methods, member
   *                           variables. Created unitTest.References #924.
