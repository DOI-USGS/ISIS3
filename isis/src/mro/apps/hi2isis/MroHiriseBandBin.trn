# The Group names can NOT be repeated.
#
# InputGroup is a comma delimited list of objects and/or
# groups in the foreign label. Traversing this list will
# lead to the correct level to find the foreign keyword.

# InputKey is the keyword within the group which holds
# the information.
#
# InputDefault is the value used if there is no value for
# the keyword
#
# Translation is the native and corresponding foreign values.
# Translation may be repeated as needed.
