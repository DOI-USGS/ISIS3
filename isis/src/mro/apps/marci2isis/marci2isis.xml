      Import an MRO MARCI image to an Isis cube
    </brief>

    <description>
        This program takes an image from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Color Imager
        and produces an Isis cube containing the image data.

            This should be the base filename of resultant cube. The output will actually be two cubes,
            with "even" and "odd" added to the filename.

          <description>
            The result of how MARCI takes pictures leaves a filter height offset in adjacent filters. This will correct that offset
            by adding padding to the top of the image file, aligning color images correctly.

          <description>
            The filters are offset by a certain number of filters, which is a multiple of their height. It appears
            the filters are all offset by twice their height, or two filter heights. One filter height can be explained by
            the method of taking pictures: the first filter on the first framelet is one higher than the second filter on
            the first framelet.

              This option will look at the correlation between the first framelet's data and the second framelet's data. 
              If there is a better correlation between the end of the first framelet and the end of the second
              framelet compared to the beginning of the second framelet, the framelets will be flipped. This only
              correlates the first filter's data.

                On ascending orbits, the framelets are aligned incorrectly. This option will mirror the framelets to correct this problem.

          Importing a MARCI EDR

          This example covers importing a typical MARCI EDR using the various FLIP options.

          <description>
            This is the command line for running this program with a typical EDR. FLIP should be AUTO, YES, or NO.

              Since this particular input image had a RED, GREEN, and ORANGE filter, it was possible to display the image
              in color. To give a better picture of the outputs, because MARCI takes long strips of data, this image was
              cropped at line 2800 to a height of 1000 pixels. This image was created with FLIP set to AUTO, which decided to
              flip the data.

              Since this particular input image had a RED, GREEN, and ORANGE filter, it was possible to display the image
              in color. To give a better picture of the outputs, because MARCI takes long strips of data, this image was
              cropped. In order to show the same feature as the flipped image, the crop was at line 5800 to a height of 1000 pixels. 
              This image was created with FLIP set to NO, because AUTO flipped the data. When you look closely, especially compared
              to the flipped data, the features in this data are distorted.
