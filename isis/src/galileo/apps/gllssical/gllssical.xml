    This program is used to radiometrically correct flight images using a
    linear model of the light-transfer function.  This program is specific to
    the Galileo SSI camera.

    This program will radiometrically correct the input image, converting the
    input DN values to some specified radiometric unit (either I/F or
    radiance).  The program requires a radiometric file generated from
    calibration data acquired at the same filter position as the input image,
    and a dark-current file acquired at the same camera gain-state, frame-rate,
    PNI, and BPM settings.  Also, extended exposure mode frames require an
    extended-exposure mode dark-current file.
    <br/><br/>
    
    This program extracts the filter position, exposure time, and frame-rate
    from the label of the input file to determine the required gain file
    to use.  The file $ISISDATA/galileo/calibration/gll_gain.sav defines the 
    gain file to use for the given filter, gain state, and frame mode.  The
    file $ISISDATA/galileo/calibration/gll_dc.sav defines the DC file to use
    for the given, gain state, frame mode, frame rate, blemish protection mode,
    clock mode, and extended exposure mode.
    <br/><br/>
    
    This program performs the following processing steps on each pixel:
    <ol>
      <li>
        The radiometric correction is applied:
        <pre>
          e = z(d - dc)

          where:
            z is retrieved from the Radiometric File.
            d is the DN.
            dc is retrieved from the Dark-Current File.
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        The output pixel is scaled to radiometric units R (units of reflectance
        or units of radiance). If output units are I/F, the following equation
        is used:
        <pre> 
    		     S1       K
          r = e * -------- * --- (D/5.2)<sup>2</sup>
    		  A1(t-to)    Ko

          where:
            S1 = filter-dependent conversion factor from ft-Lamberts to
                 I/F units for a reference distance of 5.2 AU from the Sun.
            A1 = output picture scale factor (see SCALE parameter for more info).
            t  = commanded exposure time of the input image (msec).
            to = line-dependent shutter offset.
            K  = system gain constant for the gain-state of the image.
            Ko = system gain constant for the calibration file gain-state.
            D  = target distance from the Sun (in AU).
        </pre>

        If output units are in radiance, the following equation is used:
        <pre>
    		     S2       K
          r = e * -------- * ---
    		  A2(t-to)    Ko

          where:
            S2 = filter-dependent conversion factor from ft-Lamberts to
                 units of nanowatts/cm<sup>2</sup>/steradian/nanometer.
            A2 = output picture scale factor (see SCALE parameter for more info).
            t  = commanded exposure time of the input image (msec).
            to = line-dependent shutter offset.
            K  = system gain constant for the gain-state of the image.
            Ko = system gain constant for the calibration file gain-state.
        </pre>
        Note: The original version of this equation (found in GALSOS) was
        multiplied by 10,000. The Isis 2 version of the program chose to
        remove this scaling factor, so we do the same here.
      </li>
      <li>
        The output DN is usually in the range of 0.0 to 1.0.
      </li>
    </ol>

    If the uneven bit weighting correction is enabled, the input DN values (d)
    will be corrected for uneven-bit-weighting due to the ADC.  If the input
    dark-current file is in byte format (i.e. an individual
    dark-current frame), then the correction will be applied to the
    dark-current as well. The current correction table was supplied by Herb
    Breneman, 2 Mar 89, and is based on 1975 calibration data.
    <br/><br/>

    Please note that the original Isis 2 version of this app (ssical) included
    negative I/F values in the output. We will not be supporting this behavior
    as negative I/F are not useful and do not make sense. Thus, this app
    outputs LRS for any negative I/F values that are encountered.

    <p> 
    If run on a non-spiceinited cube, this program requires access to local mission-specific 
    SPICE kernels, in order to find the distance between the sun and the target body. 
    When run on a spiceinited cube, this can be determined using the camera model.
    Using a spiceinited cube as input has the advantage of not requiring that local 
    mission-specific kernels be available. (See spiceinit web=true.)

          If output units are in I/F, the scale factor is the number of I/F
          units per DN, where 10,000 I/F units would be produced by normal
          incidence of sunlight on a Lambert disk at the planet's distance
          from the sun.

          of nanowatts per cm<sup>2</sup> per steradian per nanometer
