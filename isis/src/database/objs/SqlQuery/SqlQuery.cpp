 * This constructor will take a query string and an optional database

 * the caller does not provide a Database, the default one is used and a
 * connection is automatically attempted.
 * 
 * It can be used to execute an initial query and is perhaps the most powerful
 * example of the Isis database design.  It could be used as the starting point
 * for any database access and an initial query in one line of code.  For
 * example, below is a line of code that executes a line of code showing all the
 * tables in a PostgreSQL database using the default database:
 * @code
 *   SqlQuery pgtables("select tblname from pg_tables");
 * @endcode
 * 
 * This will use the Database() default constructor since one is not explicitly
 * provide.  That constructor attempts a connection using the default database
 * access profile as read from your IsisPreferences file.  Its default behaviour
 * is to initiate the connection to the database.  If that suceeds, the query is
 * issued.  The resulting \a pgtables SqlQuery object can now be contiually used
 * for other queries until it goes out of scope.
