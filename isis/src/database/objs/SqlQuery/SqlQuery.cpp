   * specification and execute the query all after the initial construction.  If
   * the caller does not provide a Database, the default one is used and a
   * connection is automatically attempted.
   *
   * It can be used to execute an initial query and is perhaps the most powerful
   * example of the Isis database design.  It could be used as the starting point
   * for any database access and an initial query in one line of code.  For
   * example, below is a line of code that executes a line of code showing all the
   * tables in a PostgreSQL database using the default database:
   * @code
   *   SqlQuery pgtables("select tblname from pg_tables");
   * @endcode
   *
   * This will use the Database() default constructor since one is not explicitly
   * provide.  That constructor attempts a connection using the default database
   * access profile as read from your IsisPreferences file.  Its default behaviour
   * is to initiate the connection to the database.  If that suceeds, the query is
   * issued.  The resulting \a pgtables SqlQuery object can now be contiually used
   * for other queries until it goes out of scope.
   *
   *
   * @param query IString containing a valid SQL query to execute
   * @param db    An optional database object to issue the query to.  This
