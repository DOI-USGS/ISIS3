  /**
   *  @brief DbAccess manages programatic access to a database through profiles
   *
   *  This class reads a Pvl formatted file and constructs access profiles on the
   *  fly from the contents.  It is intended to specify any and all information
   *  sufficient to establish a database connection in software applications.
   *
   *  The input file to this class is typically created with an editor.  It can
   *  contain any keyword = value combination.  It must contain a \b Database
   *  object and may optionally contain \b Profile groups.  The \b Database object
   *  can contain kewords such as \a User, \a Host, \a DbName, and so forth.  Here
   *  is an example of what the file, named upc.conf, of this type would look
   *  like:
   *
   *  @code
   *  Object = Database
   *    Name = UPC
   *    Dbname = upc
   *    Type = PostgreSQL
   *    Host = "upcdb0.wr.usgs.gov"
   *    Port = 3309
   *    Description = "UPC provides GIS-capable image searches"
   *    AlternateHosts = "upcdb1.wr.usgs.gov"
   *  EndObject
   * @endcode
   *
   * The code used to load and access this profile is:
   *
   * @code
   *   DbAccess upc("upc.conf");
   *   DbProfile default = upc.getProfile();
   * @endcode
   *
   * Additionally, you can add specific profiles that alter some or all of the
   * parameters contained in the Object section of the file.  Simply add one or
   * more \a Profile groups that grant or specify different access profiles for
   * the given database.  For example the example below names the Profile
   * "upcread" and adds an additional user and password to the profile.
   *
   * @code
   *  Object = Database
   *    Name = UPC
   *    Dbname = upc
   *    Type = PostgreSQL
   *    Host = "upcdb0.wr.usgs.gov"
   *    Port = 3309
   *    Description = "UPC provides GIS-capable image searches"
   *    AlternateHosts = "upcdb1.wr.usgs.gov"
   *    DefaultProfile = "upcread"
   *
   *    Group = Profile
   *      Name = "upcread"
   *      User = "upcread"
   *      Password = "public"
   *    EndGroup
   *  EndObject
   * @endcode
   *
   * To access this profile, use:
   *
   * @code
   *   DbProfile upcread = upc.getProfile("upcread");
   * @endcode
   *
   * It will look for the \a Name keyword as the specifed named profile.  What
   * actually happens when the above code is invoked is all the keywords
   * contained in the Database object, such as \a Dbname, \a Type, as well as
   * \a Name are copied to a new \e dynamic profile named "upcread".  Then any
   * keywords found in the actual Profile group with Name = "upcread" are copied
   * to the newly created dynamic one replacing any existing keywords with the
   * ones found in the requested Profile.  This ensures precedence is given to
   * requested profiles and common parameters in the Database object are
   * retained.
