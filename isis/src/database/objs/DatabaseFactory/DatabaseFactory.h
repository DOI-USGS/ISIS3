/**                                          
 * @brief Create database interfaces using access profiles or generic drivers
 * 
 * This class provides two major components for database programming: database
 * drivers and access profiles.  This class is implemented as a Singleton (see
 * GoF Design Patterns).  As such, it serves as a single access point for
 * drivers and profiles.  It should become clear why database access profiles
 * are also provided in this class after reading the subsequent documentation.
 * 
 * This class creates Qt QSqlDatabase objects and subsequent use of the
 * resulting objects from this class are dependant on a valid Qt environment.
 * At the time this class was developed, Qt provides database drivers as
 * plugins and this class assumes they are already available within the Qt
 * environment.  See the Qt documentation for details on options to provide
 * database drivers in the Qt environment.  Note, however, that the existance of
 * Qt database drivers in not required to build this class or supporting
 * classes.  Proper use of instantiated classes does require database drivers to
 * exist in the Qt environment.
 * 
 * The names of the Qt drivers is an issue.  Qt names their drivers obscurely so
 * that it is not readily obvious what, for example, is the MySQL driver name.
 * This class uses access profiles, described below, that name the type of
 * database you expect to access.  This implies the user must know if the
 * database is Oracle, PostgreSQL or MySQL and specify the proper name in the
 * access profile. The Qt PostgreSQL driver is called \a QPSQL. This class tests
 * for the specifc Qt named drivers and adds formal names to the driver list.
 * For example, if the \a QPSQL exists, a driver named \a PostgreSQL is also
 * added/available.  If the MySQL Qt driver, \a QMYSQL, exists, \a MySQL is also
 * added to the available drivers.  For this reason, it is recommededd that
 * access profiles use the formal names instead of the Qt driver names...just
 * in case we decided to discontinue use of Qt as the database framework and
 * replace it with another.
 * 
 * This factory generates database driver instances whereby access is defined by
 * database access profiles.  The primary profile is specified in the
 * IsisPreferences file in the Database group.  Access profiels are established
 * by user preferences as read from the $HOME/.Isis/IsisPreferences. In the
 * \b Database group, the \b AccessConfig keyword contains a full path to a
 * database profile.  This file contains a Database object with a AccessConfig
 * keyword that specifies the full path to a file that contains database access
 * information and optionally a DefaultProfile that indicates the default
 * profile to use when creating an unnamed database.  Note that the database
 * profile file may also indicate a default, but the value of DefaultProfile
 * overrides this default so certain applications and uses can govern behavior
 * if needed.
 * 
 * The intended strategy behind this design is to allow the profile file to
 * specify the read only access configuration to the database.  An unnamed
 * request to create a database will use the named default and create a driver
 * to the requesting application when accessing a database.  If an application
 * is designed to update the contents of the database, the user can specify the
 * access to the database and specify the name of the profile in the profile
 * file that provides write access to the database.  The DefaultProfile keyword
 * in the database group is used to specify the name of the profile.
 * 
 * Below is an example of a Database group contained within your personal
 * IsisPreferences file describing the location of the Database access profile
 * file is and a commented example of how to specify the default profile to use
 * when an unnamed database instantiation is requested:
 *
 * @code
 * ########################################################
 * # Customize the database configuration upon startup
 * # of any database type application
 * ########################################################
 * Group = Database
 *   AccessConfig = $HOME/.Isis/database/upc.conf
 * # DefaultProfile = upc
 * EndGroup
 * @endcode
 *
 * The specification of AccessConfig indicates the file that this object reads
 * when it is instantiated.  The file, in this case, upc.conf, should contain
 * a Database object and one or more Profile Groups.  Although DefaultProfile is
 * commented, it is also reflected in the profile file as illustrated below.  If
 * the user wants write or update access, he could simple set the value of
 * \b DefaultProfile to \b UpcWrite, uncomment it and the \b UpcWrite profile
 * then becomes the default database connection.
 * 
 * Below is an example of the contents of a database access configuration
 * profile file:
 * @code
 * Object = Database
 *   Name = UPC
 *   Dbname = upc
 *   Type = PostgreSQL
 *   Host = "upcdb0.wr.usgs.gov"
 *   Port = 3309
 *   Description = "UPC provides GIS-capable image searches"
 *   AlternateHosts = "upcdb1.wr.usgs.gov"
 *   DefaultProfile = Upc
 *
 *   Group = Profile
 *     Name = Upc
 *     User = "upcread"
 *     Access = ReadOnly
 *     Password = "public"
 *   EndGroup
 *   
 *   Group = Profile
 *     Name = UpcWrite
 *     User = "upcwrite"
 *     Access = Update
 *   EndGroup
 *          
 *   Group = Profile
 *     Name = UpcAdmin
 *     User = "upcmgr"
 *     Access = Admin
 *   EndGroup
 * EndObject
 * @endcode
 * 
 * Not all the keywords are critical/required but some are needed in order to
 * sucessfully acquire access to a specified database.  The \b Dbname keyword is
 * needed to specify the name of the database to access.  Options include
 * \b User which specifies the name of the database user that provides access to
 * the database; \b Password is an optional password if the user account
 * requires one - note that under most conditions, it is unwise to reveal a
 * password in this fashion.  It is only advisable if the database user has read
 * only access specified in its access conditions or if file permissions are set
 * such that no other user can see the contents, which is still not advised.
 * Users can utilize other access methods, such as environment variables, or
 * whatever the database access system provides.  FOr example, PostgreSQL uses
 * the
 * <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/interactive/libpq.html">libpq</a>
 * library and it has some additional access provisions.  You could set
 * <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/interactive/libpq-envars.html">
 * environment variables</a> or use the
 * <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/interactive/libpq-pgpass.html">
 * password file</a> to create a more secure access scheme. Check your database
 * documentations for additional access options; \b Host is used to provide the
 * name of the dababase host computer. And \b Port specifies a specific port
 * number to use to connect. See the Qt QSqlDatabase documentation for access
 * specifics.  This access scheme is used directly in this class.
 * 
 * When selecting a specific Profile from within the Database object, all
 * keywords in the Database object are first copied to a new Profile.  Then the
 * requested Profile is merged with new profile and given the name of the group
 * profile. Under this scenario, it is intended to provide a cascading hierarchy
 * of access parameters, whereby the Profile keywords take precendence.  For any
 * keywords that exist in both the Database object section and the specfied
 * profile, the keywords in the Profile group replace those in the Database
 * section.  In the above example, the keyword \b Name exists in both the
 * Database section and each Profile group. When the default profile \b Upc is
 * selected, the \b Name keyword in the Profile group eith the value \b Upc
 * replaces the one in the Database section that has the value \b UPC.
 * 
 * For example the code to select the \b Upc profile is:
 * 
 * @code
 *   DatabaseFactory *factory = DatabaseFactory::instance();
 *   DbProfile upc = factory->getProfile("upc");
 * @endcode
 * 
 * Using the above example configuration scheme, the resulting \b Upc profile
 * looks like this:
 * 
 * @code
 *   Group = Profile
 *     Name = Upc
 *     Dbname = upc
 *     Type = PostgreSQL
 *     Host = "upcdb0.wr.usgs.gov"
 *     Port = 3309
 *     Description = "UPC provides GIS-capable image searches"
 *     AlternateHosts = "upcdb1.wr.usgs.gov"
 *     DefaultProfile = Upc
 *     User = "upcread"
 *     Access = ReadOnly
 *     Password = "public"
 *   EndGroup
 * @endcode
 * 
 * This allows each Profile group to change any or all access parameters, even
 * the type of database (PostgreSQL to MySQL, for example) it needs.
 * 
 * When the DatabaseFactory is invoked for the first time, the users preference
 * file is loaded and the default Database AccessConfig file is read.  It
 * governs all further access unless the programmer specifically codes its own
 * access parameters, which is still possible through this class.
 * 
 * This is an example using this class to craft explicit access to a database
 * named \b upc:
 * @code
 *  DatabaseFactory *factory = DatabaseFactory::getInstance();
 *  QSqlDatabase upc = factory->create("Postgresql", "upctest");
 *  upc.setHostName("upcdb0");
 *  upc.setUserName("upcread");
 *  upc.setPassword("public");
 *  upc.setDatabaseName("upc");
 *  if (upc.open()) {
 *    QSqlQuery query("SELECT * FROM pg_tables where schemaname = 'public'",
 *                    upc);
 *  }
 * @endcode
 * In the above example, a database driver for PostgreSQL is created with the
 * name "upctest".  Access parameters are set explicitly and a query is issued
 * if access is successful.  Note that access schemes supported by targeted
 * databases apply.  For example, PostgreSQL will utilize environment variables
 * to supply some access parameters.  MySQL and PostgreSQL also utilize a
 * configuration file whereby access can be acheived through variables set
 * there.  These combinations should supply adequate options to provide flexible
 * options for accessing databases within the Isis system.
 *
 * See the Database class for an example of using a specific profile to provide
 * access to a database.
