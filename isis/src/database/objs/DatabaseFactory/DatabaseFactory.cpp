   * @brief Constructor establishing the startup state of this singleton
   *
   * This constructor sets up the initial state of the DatabaseFactory object.
   * This object is implementated as a singleton and must take measures to ensure
   * that at program termination, all database connections are closed.  This is
   * acheived through setting up a Qt termination function that is executed when
   * the Qt environment is exiting.
   *
   * Note that it is an error to schedule this process outside of Qt (using the
   * atexit() function) because it uses Qt classes that must be properly
   * deallocated.  This cannot be done once the Qt environment exits.
   *
   * Upon invocation of this object, a database access scheme is read.  This is
   * explained in the class documentation and will not be repeated here.
   *
   * As a safety measure, this constructor determines if a Qt application class,
   * Gui or non-Gui is initialized.  If it is not, a non-Gui QCoreApplication is
   * instantiated to properly initialize the Qt environment.  This is required in
   * order to have any Qt-based database plugins loaded and available for
   * subsequent use.  It is highly recommended that this activity occur
   * explicitily at a much higher level as it allows for greater programmer
   * application control.
