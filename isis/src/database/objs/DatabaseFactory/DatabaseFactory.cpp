 * This constructor sets up the initial state of the DatabaseFactory object.
 * This object is implementated as a singleton and must take measures to ensure
 * that at program termination, all database connections are closed.  This is
 * acheived through setting up a Qt termination function that is executed when
 * the Qt environment is exiting.
 * 
 * Note that it is an error to schedule this process outside of Qt (using the
 * atexit() function) because it uses Qt classes that must be properly
 * deallocated.  This cannot be done once the Qt environment exits.
 * 
 * Upon invocation of this object, a database access scheme is read.  This is
 * explained in the class documentation and will not be repeated here.
 * 
 * As a safety measure, this constructor determines if a Qt application class,
 * Gui or non-Gui is initialized.  If it is not, a non-Gui QCoreApplication is
 * instantiated to properly initialize the Qt environment.  This is required in
 * order to have any Qt-based database plugins loaded and available for
 * subsequent use.  It is highly recommended that this activity occur
 * explicitily at a much higher level as it allows for greater programmer
 * application control.
