  <brief>
    Improves camera pointing and a whole lot more!
  </brief>

  <description>
    <p>
      The <b>jigsaw</b> application performs a bundle adjustment on a group of overlapping Isis,
      level 1, <def>cube</def>s from framing and/or line-scan cameras.  The adjustment
      simultaneously defines the selected image geometry information (camera pointing, spacecraft
      position) and <def>control point</def> coordinates (x,y,z or lat,lon,radius) to reduce
      boundary mismatches in mosaics of the images.
    </p>
    <p>
      This functionality is demonstrated below in a zoomed-in area of a mosaic of a
      pair of overlapping Messenger images.  In the before jigsaw mosaic on the left
      (uncontrolled), the features on the edges of the images do not match.  In the after
      jigsaw mosaic on the right (controlled), the crater edges meet correctly and the
      seam between the two images is no longer visible.
    </p>

    <img src='assets/images/mdis2_Controlled.png' alt='After jigsaw (controlled)' width='306' height='259' />

    <p>
      The <b>jigsaw</b> application assumes <b>spiceinit</b> has been run on the input <def>cube</def>s so that
      <def>SPICE</def> is included in the Isis <def>cube</def> labels in the Kernels group.  In order to
      run the program, the user must provide a list of input <def>cube</def>s, an input <def>control
      net</def>, the name of an output <def>control net</def>, and the adjustment parameters.
      <b>jigsaw</b> outputs a new <def>control net</def> that includes the initial state of the
      points in the network and their final state after the adjustment.  The initial states of
      the points are tagged as <def>a priori</def> in the <def>control net</def>, and their final
      states are tagged as <def>adjusted</def>.  The measured <def>sample</def>/<def>line</def> positions
      associated with the <def>control point</def>s in the net are not changed.  <def>SPICE</def>
      in the <def>cube</def> labels is updated at the end of the adjustment only
      if the bundle converges and the <b>UPDATE</b> parameter is selected.
    </p>

    <p>
      Optional output files can be selected to provide more information for analyzing the
      results.  <b>BUNDLEOUT_TXT</b> provides an overall summary of the bundle adjustment.
      It lists the user input parameters selected and tables of statistics for both the
      images and the points.   The image statistics can also be written to a separate
      <b>CSV</b> file and likewise for the point statistics with the <b>OUTPUT_CSV</b>
      option selected.  <b>RESIDUALS_CSV</b> provides a table of the measured image
      coordinates and the final <def>sample</def>, <def>line</def>, and overall residuals
      in both millimeters and pixels.
    </p>

    <p>
      The functional model for the bundle adjustment is the <i>collinearity
      condition</i>.  It stipulates that the camera perspective center, a ground
      point, and its associated image point measurement be collinear.  The diagram
      below demonstrates the collinear condition in a <i>bundle adjustment</i>.
      The vectors formed by connecting each object space point (target surface x,y,z)
      and its corresponding image space points (<def>sample</def>,<def>line</def>) form
      a <i>bundle</i> of light rays.

    <h4>Known Issues</h4>
      <blockquote>
      <b>Running jigsaw with a control net containing <i>JigsawRejected</i>
      flags may result in bundle failure</b>
      <p>When running <b>jigsaw</b> with <i>Outlier Rejection</i> turned on,
      control points and/or control measures may be flagged as
      <i>JigsawRejected</i> in the output control net file. If this output net
      file is then used in a subsequent <b>jigsaw</b> run, these points and
      measures will be erroneously ignored, potentially causing the bundle
      adjustment to fail.
        <blockquote>
        <b>--Workarounds</b>
        <ol>
        <li>Run jigsaw with <i>Outlier Rejection</i> <b>off</b>.</li>
        <li>Do not use the output control net file in subsequent jigsaw runs.</li>
        <li>Convert the output control net file from binary to PVL and back using
        <i><b>cnetbin2pvl</b></i> and <i><b>cnetpvl2bin</b></i>. This will
        clear the <i>JigsawRejected</i> flags.</li>
        </ol>

      <blockquote>
      <b>Solving for the target body radii (triaxial or mean) is NOT possible and
      likely increases error in the solve.</b>
      <p>
        With the current jigsaw implementation, it is NOT possible to individually
        solve for either the mean or triaxial radii as seperate calculations in
        the bundle adjustment. More specifically, the target body radii has no
        effect when solving for individual points and thus cannot be solved for in the bundle.
        A local radii solve is already part of the sequence of equations that <b>jigsaw</b>
        uses to compute various partial derivatives to populate the solve matrix.
        A seperate mean or triaxial radii solve can be applied to the target body
        and the partials from this separate application are added to the
        solve matrix. This option adds additional computation time to <b>jigsaw</b>
        and creates additional uncertainty/error in the bundle adjust. We advise
        the mean and triaxial radii solve be avoided.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are trying to generate a spheroid from a control network there are
        other programs that can do this for you. An easier but more naive method
        is ingesting the <i>OUTPUT_CSV</i> from your network, gather local radii
        information from those points, then generate a sphereiod from those local radii.

        </brief>
        <description>
          This file contains the Camera/Spacecraft parameters to use when processing
          images from different sensors. This file should be in PVL format. It should
          contain an object called SensorParameters with one group per spacecraft/instrument
          combination. The SpacecraftName and InstrumentId keywords in the Instrument group
          of an image file are used to create the name of each group in the PVL file. The
          group pertaining to each spacecraft/instrument should contain the keyword/value
          pairs needed to process images taken with that sensor:  CKDEGREE, CKSOLVEDEGREE,
          CAMSOLVE, TWIST, OVEREXISTING, SPKDEGREE, SPKSOLVEDEGREE, SPSOLVE, OVERHERMITE,
          SPACECRAFT_POSITION_SIGMA, SPACECRAFT_VELOCITY_SIGMA, SPACECRAFT_ACCELERATION_SIGMA,
          CAMERA_ANGLES_SIGMA, CAMERA_ANGULAR_VELOCITY_SIGMA, CAMERA_ANGULAR_ACCELERATION_SIGMA.
          If any of these keywords are missing, then their defaults will be used. There is
          an example template at $ISISROOT/appdata/templates/jigsaw/SensorParameters.pvl that can be
          used as a guide.

          This option will solve for <def>SPICE</def> on all cubes with a matching
          observation number as though they were a single observation.  For
          most missions, the default observation number is equivalent to the

          is an observation.  However, for the Lunar Orbiter mission, an image has a defined
          observation number that is a substring of its <def>serial number</def>.  This
          feature allows the three subframes of a Lunar Orbiter High
          Resolution frame to be treated as a single observation when this
          option is used; otherwise, each subframe is adjusted independently.

      <description>
        The degree of the polynomial being fit to in the bundle adjust
        solution.  This polynomial can be different from the one used to
        generate the <def>a priori</def> camera positions used in the first
        iteration. In the case of an instrument with a jitter problem, a
        higher degree polynomial fit for the camera position might provide
        a better solution (smaller errors). For framing cameras, the
        application automatically sets degree to 0.

         This example runs jigsaw in a very simple way using four MRO CTX images. Only the required parameters are entered, with all other parameters
         left at their default settings. This bundle solution only solves for the camera orientation (see the CAMSOLVE and TWIST parameters). This command does not
         update the SPICE information attached to the four cubes.

      <brief>Run of jigsaw parameterized for Kaguya Terrain Camera (TC) images and <b>a relative control</b> network covering the Apollo 15 landing site. </brief>
      <description>
        <p>
         A relative network is a network that connects overlapping images with tie points but has no tie points connected to a ground source. Since there is no
         connection to ground in the network, this bundle will only solve for camera specific parameters. The bundle could still solve for other parameters and be 
         correct relative to the camera position, but it would increase the complexity of the bundle. The proceeding two examples will include grounded networks, 
         so we will wait to increase the complexity of the bundle until ground points are included. Additionally, in this example we are evaluating the solution and 
         do not want to apply it to the images yet, therefore, update is set to 'no'.
        </p> 
        <p>
         This relative bundle turns on and parameterizes the camera twist and camera acceleration solve parameters. Camera twist is a flag that allows the bundle to solve 
         for the camera's rotation around the bore sight axis and uses the same uncertainty estimation as the other two rotations. Setting the camera solve parameter to acceleration, however, 
         does require uncertainties to be set for the angles (deg), angular velocity (deg/s), and angular accelerations (deg/s**2). These values were set with increasing 
         constraint because of the increasing affect alterations of higher order parameters have on the bundle solution.
        </p>
        <p>
         The 'overexisting' flag tells the bundle solution to approximate the camera rotation with a zero polynomial function added to the existing rotation data (adding the 
         polynomial <b>over</b> the <b>existing</b> data). Without the 'overexisting' flag, the bundle fits a polynomial to the existing rotations, throws out the existing data
         points, and uses the polynomial to calculate the approximate ephemerides when needed.
        </p>
        <p>
         This bundle also lowers the max iterations to 10 (from default 50). Lowering the max iterations does not affect the bundle solution. However, setting a lower 
         iteration limit can serve as a flag if you expect your network to bundle quickly. Finally, the sigma0 convergence criteria was not changed from its default 
         value, it was only explicitly stated in this call.

      <brief>Run of jigsaw parameterized for Kaguya Terrain Camera (TC) images and <b>an intermediate ground control</b> network covering the Apollo 15 landing site. </brief>
      <description>
        <p>
         This example jigsaw bundle is run directly after adding ground control points to the previous relative network. With ground control points inserted into the 
         bundle solution, we will expand the bundle solve parameters to attempt solving for point radius values and the position of the spacecraft.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ground points are weighted more heavily in the bundle than relative control points and adding parameters adds more complexity to the bundle solution. Therefore, it 
         is common to create and refine a network with only relative points and add ground point in <b>after</b> the relative network (and its bundle solution) is of sufficient quality. 
         The purpose of this bundle is to ensure the network bundle converges with the added ground points and solve parameters, before committing to updating the camera 
         pointing on the images, so update is set to 'no'.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to the previous solve parameters, this bundle turns on the point radius and spacecraft position solve parameters. Applying the point radius solve 
         parameter requires the point_radius_sigma to be set. This value is a representation the uncertainty (in meters) of the cameras apriori pointing corresponding to the 
         correct elevation on the shape model; this value is not a hard constraint. Often this value can be set, and the appropriateness of the set value can be checked using 
         the 'POINTS DETAIL' section of the bundleout.txt file output by jigsaw. If more than half of the radius total corrections exceed the provided sigma, the uncertainty 
         may need to be increased.
        </p>
        <p>
         Applying the space craft position solve parameter requires an uncertainty estimation through spacecraft_position_sigma (again this value is not a hard constraint). 
         The appropriateness of the provided sigma can be evaluated through the bundleout_images.csv X Correction, Y Correction, and Z Correction columns.
        </p>
        <p>
         The 'overhermite' flag allows an estimation the spacecraft position like the 'overexisting' flag estimates the camera pointing, with a zero-polynomial added over
         the existing data (for spacecraft position this is a cubic Hermite spline). These options require more memory but provide a solution more representative of small
         variations in the original ephemeris data.

      <brief>Run of jigsaw parameterized for Kaguya Terrain Camera (TC) images and <b>a final ground control</b> network covering Apollo 15 landing site. </brief>
      <description>
        <p>
         This last example is of a final jigsaw run of a grounded network. In this example all network adjustments are done, the bundle is converging, the resulting 
         residuals are acceptable, and therefore we are ready to update the camera pointing on the cubes. During the final run we turn on the error propagation flag, this 
         provides the variance-covariance matrix of the parameters, from which uncertainties can be computed. This is valuable if you plan to compute certainties for 
         your update cubes camera pointing (or any kernels resulting from these updated camera pointings).
