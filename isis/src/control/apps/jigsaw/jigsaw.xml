  <brief>
    Improves camera pointing and a whole lot more!
  </brief>

  <description>
    <p>
      The <b>jigsaw</b> application performs a bundle adjustment on a group of overlapping Isis 3, 
      level 1, <def>cube</def>s from framing and/or line-scan cameras.  The adjustment 
      simultaneously defines the selected image geometry information (camera pointing, spacecraft 
      position) and <def>control point</def> coordinates (x,y,z or lat,lon,radius) to reduce 
      boundary mismatches in mosaics of the images.
    </p>
    <p>
      This functionality is demonstrated below in a zoomed-in area of a mosaic of a 
      pair of overlapping Messenger images.  In the before jigsaw mosaic on the left 
      (uncontrolled), the features on the edges of the images do not match.  In the after 
      jigsaw mosaic on the right (controlled), the crater edges meet correctly and the 
      seam between the two images is no longer visible.
    </p>

    <img src='assets/images/mdis2_Controlled.png' alt='After jigsaw (controlled)' width='306' height='259' />

    <p>
      The <b>jigsaw</b> application assumes <b>spiceinit</b> has been run on the input <def>cube</def>s so that 
      <def>SPICE</def> is included in the Isis 3 <def>cube</def> labels in the Kernels group.  In order to 
      run the program, the user must provide a list of input <def>cube</def>s, an input <def>control
      net</def>, the name of an output <def>control net</def>, and the adjustment parameters.  
      <b>jigsaw</b> outputs a new <def>control net</def> that includes the initial state of the
      points in the network and their final state after the adjustment.  The initial states of
      the points are tagged as <def>a priori</def> in the <def>control net</def>, and their final
      states are tagged as <def>adjusted</def>.  The measured <def>sample</def>/<def>line</def> positions
      associated with the <def>control point</def>s in the net are not changed.  <def>SPICE</def> 
      in the <def>cube</def> labels is updated at the end of the adjustment only 
      if the bundle converges and the <b>UPDATE</b> parameter is selected.
    </p>

    <p>
      Optional output files can be selected to provide more information for analyzing the 
      results.  <b>BUNDLEOUT_TXT</b> provides an overall summary of the bundle adjustment.  
      It lists the user input parameters selected and tables of statistics for both the
      images and the points.   The image statistics can also be written to a separate
      <b>CSV</b> file and likewise for the point statistics with the <b>OUTPUT_CSV</b>
      option selected.  <b>RESIDUALS_CSV</b> provides a table of the measured image
      coordinates and the final <def>sample</def>, <def>line</def>, and overall residuals 
      in both millimeters and pixels.
    </p>

    <p>
      The functional model for the bundle adjustment is the <i>collinearity 
      condition</i>.  It stipulates that the camera perspective center, a ground
      point, and its associated image point measurement be collinear.  The diagram 
      below demonstrates the collinear condition in a <i>bundle adjustment</i>.
      The vectors formed by connecting each object space point (target surface x,y,z) 
      and its corresponding image space points (<def>sample</def>,<def>line</def>) form 
      a <i>bundle</i> of light rays.

    <h4>Known Issues</h4>
      <blockquote>
      <b>Running jigsaw with a control net containing <i>JigsawRejected</i>
      flags may result in bundle failure</b>
      <p>When running <b>jigsaw</b> with <i>Outlier Rejection</i> turned on,
      control points and/or control measures may be flagged as
      <i>JigsawRejected</i> in the output control net file. If this output net
      file is then used in a subsequent <b>jigsaw</b> run, these points and
      measures will be erroneously ignored, potentially causing the bundle
      adjustment to fail.
        <blockquote>
        <b>--Workarounds</b>
        <ol>
        <li>Run jigsaw with <i>Outlier Rejection</i> <b>off</b>.</li>
        <li>Do not use the output control net file in subsequent jigsaw runs.</li>
        <li>Convert the output control net file from binary to PVL and back using
        <i><b>cnetbin2pvl</b></i> and <i><b>cnetpvl2bin</b></i>. This will
        clear the <i>JigsawRejected</i> flags.</li>

 <!-- Turning off USEPVL and SC_PARAMETERS for now. Since we are now using observation numbers
      to obtain the BundleObservationSolveSettings for a BundleObservation (instead of inst. id),
      this would require using a PVL that contains names of lists of images to group by.
      E.g. Group = "listA." would create a BundleObservationSolveSettings object that is associated
      with the images' observation numbers. Group = "listB.lis" would create another BOSS object
      that is associated with listB's images' observation numbers. Use of these lists could

        generate the <def>a priori</def> camera positions used in the first
        iteration. In the case of an instrument with a jitter problem, a
        higher degree polynomial fit for the camera position might provide
        a better solution (smaller errors). For framing cameras, the
        application automatically sets degree to 0.
