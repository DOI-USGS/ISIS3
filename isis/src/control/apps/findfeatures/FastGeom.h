/**
 * @brief Compute fast geom transform for pair of images
 *  
 * This class computes a fast geometric transformation of a query and train 
 * image pair using available geometry. 
 *  
 * It is assumed the two images have overlapping regions and in these regions 
 * there are geometries that map from one image to the other. 
 *  
 * There are three types of fast geometric transforms that are computed in this 
 * class: camera, crop and map. 
 *  
 * The camera fast geom works in the same way that the ISIS application cam2map 
 * works. It transforms the train image directly into camera space of the query 
 * image. The crop fast transform option computes the common area of overlap of 
 * the train image and minimumizes the outputs size of the transformed image. 
 * The map fast transform behaves just like cam2map where the output image is 
 * fully retained and projected into the camera space. This option has the 
 * highest degree of problems that can occur particularly if the image scales 
 * differ significantly. 
 *  
 * The resulting fast geom transform is added to the train transform list. This 
 * approach is well suited for the template MatchMaker::foreachpPair method.
