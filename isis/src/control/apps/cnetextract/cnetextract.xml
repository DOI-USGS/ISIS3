  <brief>
    Extracts portions of an existing Control Network
  </brief>

  <description>
    <p>
      Extracts Control Points into a new Control Network from a specified
      Control Network in accordance to specified filters.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently, the filters are divided into four categories: Exclusive
      Filters, Inclusive Filters, Cube Filters, and Lat/Lon Filters.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Exclusive Filters</strong> prevent extraction. They are taken
      into consideration last and have the highest priority. This means that
      if any other filter creates a selected Exclusive Filter condition during
      processing, that Exclusive Filter will prevent the extraction. For
      example, if the Cube Filters CUBES, CUBELIST, and CUBEMEASURES are used
      along with the Exclusive Filter NOSINGLEMEASURES, then an input Control
      Point which contains only one cube in the CUBELIST will not be
      extracted, regardless of the number of Control Measures it had on input.
      This is because NOSINGLEMEASURES will see it as a Control Point with
      exactly one Control Measure and prevent its extraction. If only
      Exclusive Filters are used, all Control Points/Measures that do not have
      an exclusive property will be extracted.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Inclusive Filters</strong> allow extraction. They only extract
      Control Points and/or Measures that are included in the Inclusive
      Filter. In addition, each Inclusive Filter is associated with an
      explicit property of the Control Point/Measure. If more than one
      Inclusive Filter is selected, only Control Points/Measures that contain
      all inclusive properties will be extracted.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Cube Filters</strong> also allow extraction, however, they
      pertain to the cubes contained within the Control Points/Measures.
      Option RETAIN_REFERENCE will extract the Reference even if not in the
      Cube List.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Lat/Lon Filters</strong> allow extraction as well, however, they
      only extract Control Points/Measures that lie in the lat/lon bounding
      box.
    </p>
    <p>
      A summary of the Control Points not extracted, listed by the filter which
      prevented them from being extracted, can be included in optional report
      files. See the PREFIX and filter keywords for more details. The following
      table lists the output file names, the corresponding filter for the
      output file, and a description of the contents of the output file.
      These output files will only be generated if PREFIX has been defined.

      <description>
        This example shows how to use cnetextract to extract points using Cube
        filters. This will extract all points that contain at least one measure
        corresponding to the given cubes in the file list.lis (CUBES=true
        CUBELIST=list.lis). From these points, the only measures that are
        extracted will correspond to the cubelist (CUBEMEASURES=true).
        All reference measures will be extracted, whether they correspond to
        the cubelist or not (RETAIN_REFERENCE=true). Note that the
        RETAIN_REFERENCE option overrides the CUBEMEASURES option with
        respect to reference measures.

            The output report for the CUBEMEASURES and RETAIN_REFERENCE filters
            lists the 24 measures from extracted points that don't correspond
            to cubes in the given cubelist. Notice that, since RETAIN_REFERENCE
            is selected, the reference measures listed in this report indicate
            that they are extracted. Also, notice the prefix of the file name
            "new" is taken from the value passed into the PREFIX parameter.
            This file would not be created if the PREFIX parameter was left
            blank.

            If run command line, this summary will be printed in the terminal
            window. If run in GUI, this summary will be printed in the log area.
            Notice that the report shows MeasurelessPoints even though the
            NOMEASURELESS parameter was not selected. However, this parameter is
            automatically selected when CUBEMEASURES is selected.
