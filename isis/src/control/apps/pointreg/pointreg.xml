  <brief>
    Automatically register control measures to their point's reference
  </brief>

  <description>
    <p>
      The main purpose of "pointreg" is to apply a chosen pattern matching
      algorithm (DEFFILE) to subpixel (or, less commonly, whole pixel) register
      individual <def>control point</def> coordinates (<def link="Control
        Measure">measures</def>) that have been collected between images and
      stored within an input <def>control network</def>.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Pointreg" requires that for every <def>serial number</def> (SN) that
      exists in the input control network, there is an existing cube file and
      its associated filename is included within the input list (FROMLIST).
    </p>

    <p>
      Most often the input control point network (CNET) contains
      <def>A priori</def>  <def>sample</def> and <def>line</def> positions based
      on the original <def>SPICE</def> of the images.  For creating an initial
      control network, refer to applications such as "autoseed", "seedgrid"
      and/or "qnet".
    </p>

    <p>
      Due to many factors, often including inaccuracies with the camera
      pointing, the control point's initial measure coordinates between images
      are not registered to one another with subpixel -- or even whole pixel --
      accuracy.
    </p>

    <p>
      The input control network contains certain fields that are evaluated by
      "pointreg" (POINTS, MEASURES) in order to know whether or not to work on a
      control point and the associated measures.  "Pointreg" in turn adds or
      updates fields in the output control network that reflect the successes
      and failures of the pattern matching for each measure.
    </p>

    <p>
      For every control point within the input network, there are control measures.
      For each control point there is always one and only one associated
      <def link="Reference Measure">reference measure</def>, either set explicitly
      or chosen at runtime implicitly.  Explicit references are chosen and defined
      as such either manually by users ("qnet") or automatically with an interest
      operator ("cnetref").  Implicit references are determined when no explicit
      reference is set for a point. In such a case, the control point will provide
      its first valid (Ignore=False) measure to act as the reference.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once "pointreg" has a reference measure for a point, it attempts to
      register every other measure in the point to that reference location. 
      An implicit reference will then be made explicit, and if any of the
      registrations succeed, the reference will also be made valid.
    </p>

    <p>
      With every successful subpixel registration for each control measure, the
      sample and line values within the output control network
      are updated with the resulting subpixel coordinates.  Note that the reference
      measure coordinates are "fixed" while the coordinates of the remaining measures
      are adjusted based on the pattern matching output.  The a priori sample and
      line fields are assigned the original starting input pixel coordinates.
      Applications such as "qnet", will report the sample and line shift as a result
      of "pointreg".  "Pointreg" will also update the control network with the
      pattern match coefficient results such as minimum and maximum "pixel z-score"
      and "goodness of fit".
    </p>

    <p>
      With every failed subpixel registration for each control measure, the
      non-reference measure is set to ignored (Ignore=True).   If all the
      measures within a control point are ignored (Ignore=True), then the entire
      control point is set to ignored (Ignore=True) at the control point level.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pointreg requires SPICE data and an associated control network, 
      so you may need to run the following ISIS programs on your images 
      beforehand. See <a href="https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/docs/how-to-guides/image-processing/bundle-adjustment-in-isis/">Bundle Adjustment</a> for more info.

        <description>
          Validating the control network attempts to weed out false positive
          registrations based on a series of tests.  When a measure fails a
          given test, its type will be set to CANDIDATE, its line and sample
          will be reset to their apriori values, and its log data will be
          removed.  Depending on the tests selected, validation can more than
          double the runtime of the registration process.  As such, it is
          disabled (VALIDATE=SKIP) by default.  By selecting the AFTER option,
          validation will occur immediately after registration using the same
          definition file and control network.  However, the user can also

            <description>
              Selecting this option (default) will skip the validation process.
              This is useful if the user trusts the results from the program, or
              is concerned about the additional runtime cost of doing this test.

              This option will result in both the registration and validation
              processes occuring in the same run.  By doing both steps in one
              run, it saves the user from needing to keep track of the paired
              output network, cube list, and definition file from a previous run
              of pointreg.  However, this option will also result in the longest

          During the validation process, a much smaller search window can be
          used than the SearchChip from registration, as ideally, the measure
          position should move very little (if at all) if it is to be considered
          a valid registration.  By default, the search window will be the
          PatternChip expanded by the number of pixels specified by the
          WindowSize parameter on each side (from the definition file, defaults
          to 5).

        <description>
          <p>
            Differences in image resolution can often lead to poor
            registrations.  Because validation is itself a registration process,
            it can also lead to poor validations.  When considering a
            registration to be validated, if the two measurements differ in
            image resolution by more than this tolerance (in meters per pixel),
            then the validation will be skipped.  By default, this value is set
            to 5.0 meters per pixel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that skipped registrations will be reported to the
            FALSEPOSITIVES report, but will <b>not</b> be reverted when the
            REVERT option is enabled.

          The maximum number of pixels a valid registration can shift
        </brief>
        <description>
          All validation tests involve registering different combinations of
          measures besides candidate-to-reference.  Consequently, the measure
          positions are likely to shift slightly from their previous
          registrations.  Ideally, there should be no shift if the two measures
          being examined are perfectly registered.  The more the measures shift
          from their previous registrations, the more likely the registrations
          are false positives.  This paraneter allows the user to specify a
          tolerance for how much a measure position can shift (in pixels) before
          the registration is considered invalid.
          <p>
            It should be noted that any shifting of measures that occurs during
            validation is for testing purposes only.  The previous registration
            will never be overridden by the results of these tests.

        In this example, the pointreg application is used to register "ignored"
        points from two images and output a new control network that omits
        ignored control points and unmeasured control measures.

           This example shows the use of pointreg with the OUTPUTIGNORED and

           This implies that only "ignored" points will be registered while
