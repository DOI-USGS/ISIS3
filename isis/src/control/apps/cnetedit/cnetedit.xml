    Edit control networks
  </brief>

  <description>
    <p>
      This application applies a series of edits to a <def>control network</def>
      based on the <def>control point</def> IDs and <def>control measure</def>
      cube filenames specified in various edit lists.  All edit operations are
      optional, and performed in a sequential order that cannot be changed.  If
      the user wises to perform any edit operations in a different order, it is
      suggested that they run the application multiple times in a pipeline
      fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The primary, and most typical, function of this application is to
      selectively delete unwanted points and measures from a network by flagging
      them as "ignored".  Other operations are generally in place to facilitate
      this purpose, but can also be used on their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      The available operations are as follows:
      <ol>
        <li>Unlock</li>
        <li>Ignore</li>
        <li>Delete</li>
        <li>Lock</li>
      </ol>
      Before any points or measures are ignored and deleted, the listed points
      and measures can be unlocked if edit locked in the input.  Listed points
      and measures can then be ignored, and subsequently any ignored points and
      measures can be deleted from the network.  The deletion operation deletes
      all ignored points and measures, not just those specified in the lists.
      Finally, any listed points or measures can be locked to prevent further
      modification.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additional options include the ability to preserve points with less than a
      single valid measure, ability to retain the <def link="Reference
        Measure">reference</def>, and the ability to print detailed logging results to a text file.
    </p>

          performed, then that point will be deleted as well.  This can be
          prevented by enabling the PRESERVE option.  Furthermore, the
          RETAIN_REFERENCE option can be enabled to prevent reference measures

          If enabled, the application will check the validity of each control

          the network is necessary (FROMLIST), and could result in a noticeably
          more time-intensive run of the program.  For the aforementioned
          reasons, this option is disabled by default.
