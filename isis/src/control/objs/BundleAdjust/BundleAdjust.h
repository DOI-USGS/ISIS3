   * @brief An image bundle adjustment object.
   *
   * BundleAdjust is used to perform a bundle adjustment on overlapping ISIS cubes.
   * Using the collineariy condition, BundleAdjust can construct a system of normal equations
   * and then using the CHOLMOD library, solve that system.

   *   @history 2005-05-30 Jeff Anderson, Debbie A. Cook & Tracie Sucharski - Original version
   *   @history 2007-05-29 Debbie A. Cook - Added new method iterationSummary and
   *                           changed points on held images to held instead of ground.
   *   @history 2007-07-12 Debbie A. Cook - Fixed bug in iteration statistics calculations in the
   *                           case of a single control point that was causing a divide by zero
   *                           error.
   *   @history 2007-08-25 Debbie A. Cook - Added methods and members to support instrument position
   *                           solution.
   *   @history 2007-09-17 Debbie A. Cook - Added ability to process in observation mode for Lunar
   *                           Orbiter.
   *   @history 2007-11-17 Debbie A. Cook - Added method SetSolution Method.
   *   @history 2007-12-21 Debbie A. Cook - Added member p_Degree and methods m_nsolveCamDegree and
   *                           ckDegree.
   *   @history 2008-01-11 Debbie A. Cook - Added observation mode functionality for spacecraft
   *                           position and upgraded ObservationNumber methods for compatability.
   *   @history 2008-01-14 Debbie A. Cook - Added code to solve for local radii.
   *   @history 2008-04-18 Debbie A. Cook - Added progress for ControlNet.
   *   @history 2008-06-18 Christopher Austin - Fixed ifndef.
   *   @history 2008-11-07 Tracie Sucharski - Added bool to constructors to indicate whether to
   *                           print iteration summary info to the session log. This was needed for
   *                           qtie which has no session log.
   *   @history 2008-11-22 Debbie A. Cook - Added code to wrap longitude to keep it in [0.0, 360.0].

   *                           camera methods to map a body-fixed vector to the camera because they
   *                           compute a new time for line scan cameras based on the lat/lon/radius
   *                           and the new time is used to retrieve Spice. The updated software uses
   *                           the Spice at the time of the measurement.
   *   @history 2009-02-15 Debbie A. Cook - Corrected focal length to include its sign and removed

   *   @history 2010-03-19 Debbie A. Cook - Moved partials to GroundMap classes to support Radar
   *                           sensors and modified argument list for GroundMap method ComputeXY
   *                           since it now returns cudx and cudy.
   *   @history 2010-06-18 Debbie A. Cook - Added p_cnetFile as member since it was taken out of
   *                           ControlNet.

   *                           to be called after the solution method has been set.
   *   @history 2011-02-17 Debbie A. Cook - Updated to use new parameter added to SpicePosition,
   *                           p_timeScale.
   *   @history 2011-03-05 Debbie A. Cook - Put point index creation back in init.  This will
   *                           prevent QRD and SVD from working if ground points are in the control
   *                           net.
   *   @history 2011-03-29 Ken Edmundson - Fixed bug in observation mode when solving for spacecraft

   *   @history 2011-07-14 Ken Edmundson and Debbie Cook - Added new member, m_bDeltack to indicate
   *                           calling application was deltack (or qtie) and has potential to have a

   *                           originally added on 2011-01-19), was deleted somewhere along the
   *                           line.
   *   @history 2011-09-28 Debbie A. Cook - Renamed SPARSE solve method to OLDSPARSE and CHOLMOD to

   *                           only add non-ignored ControlPoints to the BundleControlPoint, and
   *                           we only add non-ignored ControlMeasures to the BundleControlPoint.
   *                           Fixes #4173, #4201.

   *   @history 2017-05-01 Makayla Shepherd - Added imageLists() to track and return the images

   *                           Separated initializations for Normal Equations matrix out of

   *                           "coeffImage" matrix in ::computePartials. New m_startColumn member in

   *                           colums and rows. In ::errorPropagation method, call to get Q matrix
   *                           from BundleControlPoint was creating a copy instead of getting a
   *                           reference. References #4664.
   *   @history 2017-06-08 Makayla Shepherd - Modified imageLists() to close the image cube after

   *   @history 2017-08-09 Summer Stapleton - Added a try/catch around the m_controlNet assignment

   *                           Fixes #5068.
   *   @history 2017-09-01 Debbie A. Cook - Added BundleSettingsQsp as argument to
   *                            BundleControlPoint constructor and moved setWeights call from
   *                            BundleAdjust::init to BundleControlPoint constructor.  Don't allow
   *                            solving for triaxial radii when coordinate type is not Latitudinal.
   *                            Added new optional argument controlPointCoordType to ControlNet
   *                            constructor call.  References #4649 and #501.
   *   @history 2018-05-31 Debbie A. Cook - Moved productAlphaAV and control point parameter
   *                            correction code to BundleControlPoint.  Earlier revised errorPropagation to
   *                            compute the sigmas via the variance/covariance matrices instead of the sigmas.
   *                            This should produce more accurate results.  References #4649 and #501.
   *   @history 2018-05-22 Ken Edmundson - Modified methods bundleSolveInformation() and
   *                           solveCholeskyBR() to return raw pointers to a BundleSolutionInfo object.
   *                           Also modified resultsReady signal to take a raw pointer to a
   *                           BundleSolutionInfo object. This was done to avoid using a copy
   *                           constructor in the BundleSolutionInfo class because it is derived
   *                           from QObject. Note that we ultimately want to return a QSharedPointer
   *                           instead of a raw pointer.
   *   @history 2018-06-14 Christopher Combs - Added getter method to tell if a bundle adjust was
