   * @brief Interest Operator class

   * Create InterestOperator object.  Because this is a pure virtual class you
   * can not create an InterestOperator class directly.  Instead, see the
   * InterestOperatorFactory class.

   *   @history 2006-02-11 Jacob Danton - Original Version
   *   @history 2007-08-02 Steven Koechle - Added better documentation to CompareInterests().
   *   @history 2007-08-02 Steven Koechle - Fixed looping error that caused subchip to go
   *                           outside the chip to the left and top, and not check the
   *                           bottom and right.
   *   @history 2007-08-14 Steven Koechle - Added virtual method Padding() which default returns 0.
   *   @history 2007-08-16 Steven Koechle - Fixed Looping error in Operate. Made the
   *                           loops <= instead of just <. Changed from accepting one
   *                           delta to accepting a deltaSamp and a deltaLine.
