   *                           SerialNumberList class
   *   @history 2008-04-04 Christopher Austin Added Exists function
   *   @history 2008-04-18 Debbie A. Cook Added Progress reports to loading and
   *                           SetImages and calculates the total number of
   *                           measurements in the control net
   *   @history 2008-06-18 Christopher Austin Fixed documentation errors
   *   @history 2009-01-06 Jeannie Walldren Fixed typo in SetImages() exception
   *                           output. Added documentation.
   *   @history 2009-02-05 Christopher Austin when the created date or the
   *                           modified date are not set, they default to the
   *                           time in which Write() is called.
   *   @history 2009-04-07 Tracie Sucharski Added NumValidMeasures and
   *                           NumIgnoredMeasures methods.
   *   @history 2009-06-03 Christopher Austin Added p_invalid functionality
   *                           along with forceBuild, as well as other small
   *                           fixes including documentation.
   *   @history 2009-07-13 Stacy Alley The std::vector of ControlPoints called
   *                           'p_points' was replaced with a QVector of QString
   *                           'p_pointIds' in conjunction with a QHash of
   *                           <QString, ControlPoint> called 'p_pointsHash'.
   *                           This was done to speed up the Add method which
   *                           was essentially slowing down the reading or
   *                           creation of Control Networks.
   *   @history 2010-05-06 Tracie Sucharski Use defaults of 0. instead of
   *                           Isis::Null, because 0. is the default in the
   *                           protocol buffers.
   *   @history 2010-08-06 Tracie Sucharski Updated for changes made after
   *                           additional working sessions for Control network
   *                           design.
   *   @history 2009-09-01 Eric Hyer Added two includes: QVector and QString
   *   @history 2010-09-09 Sharmila Prasad Added API to sort Control Net by
   *                           Point ID Changed PointID's vector to StringList
   *   @history 2009-09-25 Travis Addair Changed methods which return the number
   *                           of control measures in the network to compute
   *                           those values at the time the method is called,
   *                           not when the control network is first
   *                           initialized.
   *   @history 2010-10-05 Tracie Sucharski Renamed the Write method to
   *                           WritePvl.  Create new method, Write which takes
   *                           another parameter indicating whether to write pvl
   *                           format or binary format, The default will write
   *                           binary.
   *   @history 2010-10-05 Eric Hyer ControlMeasure and ControlPoint now
   *                           return QStrings for some methods.  Fixed
   *                           breakages caused by this.
   *   @history 2010-10-06 Sharmila Prasad Added method to get CreatedDate
   *   @history 2010-11-21 Tracie Sucharski - Added new keyword, jigsawRejected
   *                           to the read and write methods.
   *   @history 2011-01-13 Mackenzie Boyd Added copy constructor and assignment
   *                           operator.
   *   @history 2011-01-17 Eric Hyer - Points are now owned and deleted by the
   *                           network.  Network now stored in such a way that
   *                           access to all points in a cube is just as cheap
   *                           as accessing measures in a point.  Removed
   *                           redundant methods and made other api changes.
   *   @history 2011-02-18 Eric Hyer - Made improvements and bug fixes related
   *                           to interaction to other control network classes
   *                           including ControlPoint and ControlMesure, but
   *                           most significantly to ControlCubeGraphNode.  Most
   *                           important fix was network notification of
   *                           measures added to or removed from points after
   *                           the point is added to the network.
   *   @history 2011-02-23 Eric Hyer - Added some methods to support graphing

   *                           method GetTargetRadii to support SurfacePoint
   *                           sigma conversions in ControlPoint.
   *   @history 2011-03-14 Eric Hyer - Cube connection graph now updated when
   *                           points or measures are ignored.
   *   @history 2011-03-15 Eric Hyer - Some cube graph bugs were fixed.
   *   @history 2011-03-25 Christopher Austin - Added UpdatePointReference() to
   *                           work with ControlPoint's SetId()
   *   @history 2011-03-29 Steven Lambright - Made versioning viable for first
   *                           release.
   *   @history 2011-04-27 Steven Lambright - UpdatePointReference had a bug
   *                           where the pointIds list was not being correctly
   *                           updated.
   *   @history 2011-05-04 Eric Hyer - References in graph data structure now

   *   @history 2013-11-08 Tracie Sucharski - Add camera to ignored measures.  References #1603.
   *   @history 2013-12-18 Tracie Sucharski - Previous change caused problems for jigsaw app.  It
   *                           was expecting the method GetNumberOfMeasuresInImage to only return
   *                           the number of VALID (Ignore=False) measures.  Renamed
   *                           method to GetNumberOfValidMeasuresInImage and the private
   *                           variable p_cameraMeasuresMap to p_cameraValidMeasuresMap. References

   *                           added clear() and take() methods.
   *                           (Merged by Kristin Berry. References #2392)
   *   @history 2016-04-22 Jeannie Backer - Added try/catch to SetTarget()'s call to
   *                           TProjection::TargetRadii(). If an error is thrown, the radii are
   *                           now set to Isis:Null. Added SetTarget(Pvl), SetTarget(ControlNet),
   *                           and SetTarget(QString, vector) methods to attempt to read radii from
   *                           various sources, if not found using the TargetName. References #3892
   *   @history 2016-04-28 Tracie Sucharski - Updated toAscii() calls to toLatin1() for QT 5 upgrade.
   *   @history 2016-05-10 Jeannie Backer - Replaced calls to TProjection::TargetRadii() with calls
   *                           to Target::radiiGroup(). References #3934

   *   @history 2016-06-08 Jesse Mapel - Merged changes from IPCE to ISIS.  Fixes #3948.
   *   @history 2016-10-13 Ian Humphrey - Added check to SetImages() to make sure it isn't called
   *                           more than once, which messes up the p_cameraList member. References
   *                           #4293.
   *   @history 2017-08-09 Summer Stapleton - Added throw to caught exception for bad control net
   *                           import in constructor. Also removed p_invalid as it was no longer
   *                           being used anywhere. Fixes #5068.
   *   @history 2017-08-30 Debbie A. Cook - Added an optional argument to the constructor
   *                           for the control point coordinate type.  At this point this value is only
   *                           stored in the active ControlNet.  It will be added to the stored
   *                           ControlNet at a later date.  References #4649 and #501.
   *   @history 2017-12-12 Kristin Berry - Updated to use QMap and QVector rather than std::map
   *                           and std::vector. Fixes #5259.
   *   @history 2017-12-18 Adam Goins - Added GetLastModified() accessor. References #5258.
   *   @history 2017-12-21 Jesse Mapel - Modified read and write methods to use the refactored
   *                           ControlNetVersioner instead of directly parsing the protobuf
   *                           objects from the LatestControlNetFile.
   *   @history 2018-01-12 Adam Goins - Added Progress support back to Read methods.
   *   @history 2017-01-19 Jesse Mapel - Added a method to get all of the valid measures in an
   *                           image. Previously, this had to be done throug the graph.
   *   @history 2018-01-26 Kristin Berry - Added pointAdded() function to eliminate redundant measure
   *                           adds to the control network.
   *   @history 2018-06-10 Kristin Berry - Removed unused methods and associated code:
   *                           MinimumSpanningTree(), GetNodeConnections(), RandomBFS(), Shuffle(),
   *                           CalcBWAndCE(), CubeGraphToString(), getGraphNode(). References #5434
   *   @history 2018-06-10 Kristin Berry - Updated to use the boost graph library instead of our
   *                           custom graph structure ControlCubeGraphNode.
   *   @history 2018-04-05 Adam Goins - Added a check to the versionedReader targetRadii
   *                           group to set radii values to those ingested from the versioner
   *                           if they exist. Otherwise, we call SetTarget with the targetname.
   *                           Fixes #5361.
   *   @history 2018-06-06 Jesse Mapel - Added a method to get all adjacent images to ControlNet.
   *                           Previously this functionality was only available through the
   *                           ControlCubeGraphNode class. References #5434.
   *   @history 2018-06-06 Jesse Mapel - Added a point ignored and un-ignored methods. This will
   *                           prevent edge strengths getting incremented or decremented twice.
   *                           References #5434.
   *   @history 2018-06-15 Adam Goins & Jesse Mapel - Added the ModType enum, as well as a series
   *                           of signals that are emitted whenever a change is made to a
   *                           Control Point or any of it's measures, or to the network itself.
   *                           These signals exist for the purpose of communication between the
   *                           ControlNetVitals class, and the network that it is observing.
   *                           Fixes #5435.
   *  @history 2018-06-25 Kristin Berry - Updated GetNumberOfValidMeasuresInImage() to use
   *                           GetValidMeasuresInCube() if SetImage has not yet been called to populate
   *                           the p_cameraValidMeasuresMap.
   *   @history 2018-06-25 Jesse Mapel - Fixed the incorrect signal being called when adding and
   *                           removing measures. References #5435.
   *   @history 2018-06-29 Kristin Berry - Added addEdge() and removeEdge() functions to make
   *                           code cleaner.
   *   @history 2018-06-25 Jesse Mapel - Fixed ignoring measures with ignored adjacent measures
   *                           incorrectly modifying the edge between the two image vertices.
   *   @history 2018-07-06 Jesse Mapel - Modified addEdge and removeEdge to always emit a graph
   *                           modified signal if an edge is added or removed. Added graph
   *                           modified signal when a vertex is added.
   *   @history 2018-07-06 Jesse Mapel - Removed target radii from ControlNet objects because
   *                           SurfacePoints now use their local radii to do sigma distance
   *                           conversions instead of the target equatorial and polar radii.
   *                           Fixes #5457.
   *   @history 2018-07-22 Kristin Berry - Updated swap to include the graph and vertex map.
