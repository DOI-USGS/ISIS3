   *   @history 2005-07-29 Jeff Anderson Original version
   *   @history 2006-01-11 Jacob Danton Added ReferenceIndex method and updated
   *                           unitTest
   *   @history 2006-06-28 Tracie Sucharski, Added method to return measure
   *                           for given serial number.
   *   @history 2006-10-31 Tracie Sucharski, Added HasReference method,
   *                           changed ReferenceIndex method to throw error if
   *                           there is no Reference ControlMeasure.
   *   @history 2007-01-25 Debbie A. Cook, Removed return statement in
   *                           SetApriori method for \Point case so that
   *                           FocalPlaneMeasures will get set.  The method
   *                           already has a later return statement to avoid
   *                           changing the lat/lon values.
   *   @history 2007-10-19 Debbie A. Cook, Wrapped longitudes when calculating
   *                           apriori longitude for points with a difference of
   *                           more than 180 degrees of longitude between
   *                           measures.
   *   @history 2008-01-14 Debbie A. Cook, Changed call to
   *                           Camera->SetUniversalGround in ComputeErrors to
   *                           include the radius as an argument since the
   *                           method has been overloaded to include radius.
   *   @history 2008-09-12 Tracie Sucharski, Add method to return true/false
   *                           for existence of Serial Number.
   *   @history 2009-03-07 Debbie A. Cook Fixed ComputeErrors method to set
   *                           focal plane coordinates without changing time and
   *                           improved error messages.
   *   @history 2009-06-03 Christopher Austin, Added the invalid functionality
   *                           along with forceBuild, fixed documentation
   *                           errors.
   *   @history 2009-06-22 Jeff Anderson, Modified ComputeAprior
   *                           method to correctly handle ground and held
   *                           points. Previosuly it would throw an error if the
   *                           lat/lon of a measure could not be computed. Also,
   *                           modify the ComputeErrors method to not abort any
   *                           longer if a control point lat/lon could not be
   *                           projected back to a image line/sample.
   *   @history 2009-08-13 Debbie A. Cook Corrected calculation of
   *                           scale used to get the undistorted focal plane
   *                           coordinates to use the signed focal length (Z)
   *                           from the CameraDistortionMap,
   *   @history 2009-08-21 Christopher Austin, Put the default return of

   *   @history 2009-09-01 Eric Hyer, fixed some include issues.
   *   @history 2009-09-08 Eric Hyer, Added PointTypeToString method.
   *   @history 2009-10-13 Jeannie Walldren - Added detail to
   *                           error messages.
   *   @history 2009-12-06 Tracie Sucharski, Renamed ComputeErrors to

   *   @history 2010-03-19 Debbie A. Cook Replaced code in method ComputeErrors
   *                           with call to CameraGroundMap->GetXY
   *   @history 2010-01-12 Tracie Sucharski, Added support for binary networds,
   *                           added new parameters, renamed ComputeErrors to
   *                           ComputeResiduals, renamed MaximumError to

   *   @history 2010-03-19 Debbie A. Cook Replaced code in method ComputeErrors
   *                           with call to CameraGroundMap->GetXY
   *   @history 2010-05-06 Tracie Sucharski, Use defaults of 0. instead of
   *                           Isis::Null, because 0. is the default in the
   *                           protocol buffers.
   *   @history 2010-05-11 Sharmila Prasad Added API's Copy Constructor to copy
   *                           one point to another and
   *                           ReferenceIndexNoException not to throw Exception
   *                           if there are no reference point or no measures in
   *                           a Control Point.  Also added the boolean logical
   *                           operator method = and !=.
   *   @history 2010-05-26 Tracie Sucharski, Changed point type of Ground to
   *                           GroundXYZ, GroundXY, or GroundZ.
   *   @history 2010-06-01 Tracie Sucharski, Added Ellipsoid and DEM to
   *                           AprioriSource enum.  Change AprioriSourceBasemap
   *                           to AprioriLatLonSourcFile and
   *                           AprioriRadiusSourceFile.
   *   @history 2010-06-03 Tracie Sucharski, Moved SetReference method from
   *                           ControlMeasure so check for multiple reference
   *                           meausres can be done.
   *   @history 2010-06-17 Tracie Sucharski, Added Lock keyword, new methods
   *                           SetLocked, Locked and NumLockedMeasures.
   *   @history 2010-06-04 Eric Hyer - removed parametor for PointTypeToString()
   *                           additional working sessions for Control network
   *                           design.
   *   @history 2010-07-27 Tracie Sucharski, Updated for changes made after
   *                           additional working sessions for Control network
   *                           design.  Major change to keywords, including
   *                           storing coordinates as x/y/z instead of
   *                           lat/lon/radius.  Needed methods to allow
   *                           inputting either, and conversion methods.
   *   @history 2010-08-18 Tracie Sucharski, Updated for changes made to
   *                           SurfacePoint covariance matrix.
   *   @history 2010-08-25 Tracie Sucharski, Fixed some bugs relating to
   *                           conversions between sigmas and covariance
   *                           matrices.
   *   @history 2010-09-13 Tracie Sucharski, Added methods for setting
   *                           planetocentric sigmas as both degrees and meters,
   *                           as a result of changes made to the SurfacePoint
   *                           class.
   *   @history 2010-09-15 Tracie Sucharski, It was decided after mtg with
   *                           Debbie, Stuart, Ken and Tracie that ControlPoint
   *                           will only function with x/y/z, not
   *                           lat/lon/radius. It will be the responsibility of
   *                           the application or class using ControlPoint to
   *                           set up a SurfacePoint object to do conversions
   *                           between x/y/z and lat/lon/radius. So... remove
   *                           all conversion methods from this class. It was
   *                           also decided that when importing old networks
   *                           that contain Sigmas, the sigmas will not be
   *                           imported, due to conflicts with the units of the
   *                           sigmas.
   *   @history 2010-05-11 Sharmila Prasad Added API's Copy Constructor to copy
   *                           one point to another and
   *                           ReferenceIndexNoException not to throw Exception
   *                           if there are no reference point or no measures in
   *                           a Control Point.
   *   @history 2010-06-04 Eric Hyer - removed parametor for PointTypeToString()
   *   @history 2010-09-09 Sharmila Prasad - Added API's to get Latitude,
   *                           Longitude, Radius from the Reference Measure in
   *                           the Point. Also to get the min & max Line &
   *                           Sample Errors
   *   @history 2010-09-27 Tracie Sucharski, Removed these new methods and move
   *                           functionality to the ControlNetFilter class. Add
   *                           the old methods, SetUniversalGround,
   *                           UniversalLatitude, UniversalLongitude and Radius
   *                           back in for convenience.
   *   @history 2010-10-05 Eric Hyer - interface to ID is now with QString
   *   @history 2010-10-06 Sharmila Prasad - Added method ReferenceLocked()
   *   @history 2010-10-18 Tracie Sucharski, Change "Setters", ComputeApriori
   *                           and ComputeResiduals to return either Success or
   *                           PointLocked.  If the point is locked do not set
   *                           values.
   *   @history 2010-10-18 Tracie Sucharski, Change SurfacePoint::Rectangular
   *                           and SurfacePoint::Ocentric to SurfacePoint as
   *                           both return values and parameters.
   *   @history 2010-10-06 Sharmila Prasad - API to reset Apriori
   *   @history 2010-10-21 Steven Lambright Minimized the header file and moved
   *                           most implementations to the cpp. Reorganized the
   *                           order of methods. Made more methods callable on a
   *                           const instance. Added GetMeasure(...) methods and
   *                           a suggested implementation for the bracket
   *                           operators, not yet implemented due to returning
   *                           reference conflicts. Finished implementing the
   *                           new use of SurfacePoint mentioned in the last
   *                           history comment. Marked SetUniversalGround(),
   *                           UniversalLatitude(), UniversalLongitude(), and
   *                           Radius() as deprecated. These methods need to be
   *                           phased out and GetSurfacePoint() used instead.
   *                           There are naming conflicts with accessors (some
   *                           use Get, some don't) still. The comparison
   *                           operator now relies on QVector's comparison
   *                           operator instead of looping itself. Added private
   *                           helper methods:
   *                             int FindMeasureIndex(QString serialNumber)
   *                                 const
   *                             void PointModified();
   *                           Updated documentation extensively. Removed
   *                           everything apost except for inside of Load() and
   *                           CreatePvlObject(). Added automatic updating of
   *                           DateTime and ChooserName.
   *   @history 2010-10-26 Steven Lambright Change default chooser name from
   *                           user name to application name.
   *   @history 2010-11-03 Mackenzie Boyd Added ToString methods for enums,
   *                           String and statis ToString now exist for
   *                           PointType, RadiusSource, and SurfacePointSource.
   *   @history 2010-11-16 Debbie Cook, Added jigsawRejected keyword.
   *   @history 2010-12-08 Tracie Sucharski, Added IsGround convenience method.
   *   @history 2010-12-28 Steven Lambright Changed accessors to match
   *                           ControlMeasure's method of accessing data.
   *                           Removed obsolete methods to prevent further use
   *                           of them.
   *   @history 2011-01-13 Mackenzie Boyd Added pointer to owning ControlNet.
   *   @history 2011-01-17 Eric Hyer - Points now own and delete their measures.
   *                           ControlNet now notified of changes (like adding
   *                           and removing measures).  Returning pointers to
   *                           measures is now safe and encouraged.
   *   @history 2011-02-10 Eric Hyer - measures no longer know or care if they
   *                           are the reference measure.  This information is
   *                           now completely maintained by this class.  Made
   *                           numerous API and internal changes, eliminating
   *                           substantial duplicate code and increasing
   *                           interface clearity.  Hungarian notation now
   *                           eliminated from this class.
   *   @history 2011-02-11 Steven Lambright - Measure log data is now written to
   *                           the binary file properly.
   *   @history 2011-02-18 Eric Hyer - Added Delete(ControlMeasure *) method.
   *                           Fixed bugs related to network notification of
   *                           measure addition and deletion.
   *   @history 2011-02-28 Eric Hyer - Fixed bug in operator= that caused the
   *                           the reference measure to not get propagated
   *                           correctly
   *   @history 2011-02-28 Steven Lambright - Added a flag for cnetref to say
   *                           whether a reference measure has been explicitly
   *                           or implicitly set.
   *   @history 2011-03-01 Eric Hyer - Added StringToRadiusSource and
   *                           StringToSurfacePointSource methods
   *   @history 2011-03-08 Ken Edmundson and Debbie Cook - Added members
   *                           ConstraintStatus, LatitudeConstrained,

   *                           constraintStatus and methods
   *                           ConputeResiduals_Millimeters(),

   *                           and NumberOfConstrainedCoordinates().
   *   @history 2011-03-11 Debbie Cook - changed name of member surfacePoint to
   *                           adjustedSurfacePoint.  Also changed methods
   *                           SetSurfacePoint to SetAdjustedSurfacePoint and
   *                           GetSurfacePoint to GetAdjustedSurfacePoint.
   *   @history 2011-03-14 Eric Hyer - Added GetMeasures method.  Network now
   *                           notified when a point's ignored status changes
   *                           for updating its cube connection graph (cube
   *                           connections were not respecting ignored flags on
   *                           points / measures).
   *   @history 2011-03-14 Christopher Austin - Added GetBestSurfacePoint to
   *                           reduce external duplicate code.
   *   @history 2011-03-15 Steven Lambright - Now writes AdjustedX, AdjustedY,
