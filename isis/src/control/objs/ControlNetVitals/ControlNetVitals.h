  /**
  *
  *  @brief ControlNetVitals
  *
  *  This class is designed to represent the health of a control network.
  *  It utilizes signals and slots to listen for changes in an observed Control Network and
  *  re-evaluates the health of a network whenever a change is made.
  *  It tracks several statistics, and is intended to be the back-end for the ControlHealthMonitorWidget
  *  that is located in IPCE.
  *
  *  The ControlNetVitals class keeps track of several member variables that are a running counter
  *  for network statistics in regard to the health of the observed network. It creates these
  *  variables upon intialization and references these internal variables when returning certain
  *  statistics about a Control Network that can't be accessed by wrapper methods for the network itself.
  *  It then listens for specific signals to be emitted whenever a change is made to the network
  *  to update it's internal counters with respect to that change.
