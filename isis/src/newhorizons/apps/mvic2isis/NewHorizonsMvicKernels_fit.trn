#  All Mvic frames have the boresight in the -X directions, while Isis assumes boresight is either
#  in +/- Z direction.  A new frame was created for each Mvic ccd's to do a final rotation into the
#  Isis assumed boresight.  This is a 90 degree rotation around the Y-axis.  New Naif Id's were
#  created by simply adding 700 to the Mission Naif ID.
#
#  This was done as an extra frame rather than in the FocalPlaneMap code because of ckwriter and
#  spkwriter.
