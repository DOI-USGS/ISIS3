    Interactive control network editor
  </brief>

  <description>
    <p>
      Cneteditor allows a user to edit attributes of control points and measures
      interactively. Select keywords from a control network file are imported
      into a table of editable rows and columns. <strong>Always make a
      backup copy of the input file before using this program. There is no
      "undo" capability yet.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The basic utility of this program is to set control points or control
      measures to "ignore" or "EditLock," and to modify values assigned to
      "A Priori SP Lat Sigma," "A Priori SP Lon Sigma," and "A Priori SP Radius
      Sigma." The control point type can be changed to "Constrained," "Fixed,"
      or "Free." There are columns such as PointID or Reference which should not
      be changed. If control points or measures are set to "yes" for EditLock,
      the user is prompted to verify updated values.
    </p>
    <p>
      The control network file is loaded either by entering the filename after
      the program name on the command line or by using the file selection menu
      after invoking the program.
    </p>
    <p>
      Command line example:
      <pre>cneteditor control_network_file.net</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      On the menu bar are drop down menus "File," "Tables," and "Help."  The
      options under "File" are "Open," "Save," "Save As," "Close," and "Quit."
      The options under "Tables" are "Freeze Tables" and "Enable Sorting."
      The icons are activated only after a control network file has been loaded.
      When the sorting icon is enabled, the <strong>"^" (ascending)</strong> or
      <strong>"v" (descending)</strong> symbol appears in the activated column
      heading. The sort is performed by clicking on the symbol or by clicking on
      a different column of interest while sorting is enabled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Freeze Tables" icon (ice cube) is used to temporarily turn off the
      filtering function. It freezes the table so that edits to a cell can be
      performed without screen refresh. When the edits are completed, turn off
      the freeze pane by clicking on the icon again. Once the freeze icon is
      off, the edited information is updated in memory but not saved to disk.
      Use the "save" or "save as" options under "File" to save the file to disk.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the tables are not frozen the cells are updated based on the filters
      that have been applied as soon as a cell is edited. If more than one cell
      in a row needs to be edited then freeze the pane before changing any of
      the cells.
    </p>
    <p>
      The filters tabs presently available are "Control Points and Measures" and
      "Images and Points." The tab for "Connections" is displayed but not
      implemented yet so there are no keyword options available when the tab is
      selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The results of the filters are displayed in the "Control Point Table,
      "Control Measure Table," and the "Point View" tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      The green "+" icon can be used to add a new filter or a new filter group.
      Click the "+" icon inside the bounding box to add a new filter. Select a
      keyword to filter with such as "PointType." The "And" or "Or" logic type
      radio button must also be selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click the "+" icon outside the bounding box to add a new filter group.
      Select a keyword to filter with such as "GoodnessOfFit."  The "And" or
      "Or" logic type radio button must also be selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drop-down menu under the filter tabs lists keywords that can be
      selected for the filters. Additional filtering options can be chosen to
      include or exclude specific values by clicking on the radio icons. A text
      box will be displayed for keywords that require text or numbers. <strong>
      Be careful with extra spaces when entering text, verify entry by reading
      the filter statement if the expected result is empty.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The ">=" or "&lt;=" symbols are used to enter the cutoff numbers for
      specific keywords that are stored as numbers, and when selected there may
      be an option to select the "inclusive" or "exclusive" filter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Effect" option is used to select "Point" and/or "Measure." The
      default is both "Point" and "Measure" so there is an "X" within the radio
      icons. To turn off one or the other option, click on the desired radio
      icon; "X" means selected and no "X" means not selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the "Control Points and Measures" tab, the "Min count for points" is
      used to define how many measures a control point must have for a
      particular filter. The default value is "1" so the filtering is applied to
      control points that have at least one measure. If the "Control point"
      option under "Effect" is turned off, then the min count is not used.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Warning:</strong> Not all filters have the same effect. For
      example, some keywords require minimum and/or maximum values while others
      require text entries. <strong>It is best to read the statement above the
      filter options to see exactly what the options that has been selected is
      performing</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Editing cells:</strong>
      <br/><br/>
      Click on the cell to type the value, or double-click on the cell to see
      the valid values in the drop-down menu to select from. If no valid values
      exist, then type the text in the cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Copying to all cells:</strong>
      <br/><br/>
      Select a cell that has the content that will be copied to all cells under
      a column. Click on the selected cell to activate, and then hold down the
      right icon to select "copy to all cells."
    </p>
    <p>
      For more help click on "What"s This?" under Help, or use Shift+F1. Once
      you see the "?" on the screen, click on the screen to see the information.
