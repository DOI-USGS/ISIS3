  /**
   * @brief Provide Undo/redo abilities, serialization, and history for an operation.
   *
   *   This class should be used for operations that affect a Project and need to provide history
   *   and/or undo/redo capabilities, and the ability for the project to guarantee a
   *   good state on disk. It follows the Command Pattern using Qt's QUndoCommand framework.
   *   Not all actions require WorkOrders - many of the
   *   actions performed in the various widgets may not use WorkOrders.
   *
   *   The order of execution for work orders is:
   *   setupExecution() - GUI thread, can ask user for input
   *   execute() - run on either the GUI thread or a non-GUI thread as specified by the m_isSynchronous flag
   *   postExecution() - perform any cleanup after execute.
   *
   *
   *   undoExecution() - run on either the GUI thread or a non-GUI thread as specified by the
   *                     m_isSynchronous flag
   *   postUndoExecution() - perform any cleanup after undoExecution()
   *
   *
   *   ** Adding a new Workorder **
   *
   *   The WorkOrder will need to be determined to be either synchronous/asynchronous and
   *   whether it is undoable.  These are decisions determined by the use case.  Asynchronous
   *   WorkOrders will not block the GUI thread while running and are typically used for
   *   long-running operations.  Note that WorkOrders are not reentrant - a new one is created
   *   for each action.
   *
   *   The constructor for the WorkOrder must set m_isUndoable and m_isSynchronous to the appropriate
   *   values. The constructor must call the base WorkOrder constructor.  The default is
   *   synchronous and undoable. If an import WorkOrder is being implemented the import must be
   *   some type of object and implement certain slots.
   *
   *   All information required to execute the WorkOrder should be saved in the WorkOrder
   *   in the setupExecution() method.  Since WorkOrders may be serialized and may run on
   *   non-GUI threads there are restrictions on how the WorkOrder may save state.  To allow
   *   serialization the WorkOrders  must save state to the base WorkOrder class using
   *   WorkOrder::setInternalData() in the following calls:
   *   setupExecution(), postExecution(), postUndoExecution().
   *   Workorders may use member variables to pass data between the execute() and postExecution()
   *   methods and also between the undoExecution() and undoPostExecution() methods since
   *   serialization can not happen between these calls.  For asynchronous WorkOrders the
   *   execute()/postExecution() and undoExecution()/undoPostExecution() methods are on
   *   different threads so any allocated memory moved between the non-GUI and GUI threads
   *   between methods.
   *
   *   Serialization is handled by the base WorkOrder class.  Since all state is saved
   *   into the base class using setInternalData() the derived WorkOrders do not contain
   *   any data that needs to be serialized.  The times when WorkOrders are allowed to use
   *   member variables are periods when the WorkOrder can not be serialized.
   *
   *   There are 5 key methods in the flow of the WorkOrder as shown in the WorkOrder Flow
   *   diagram below.
   *
   *   *setupExecution*
   *   The setupExecution() method gathers all required information to run the WorkOrder but
   *   does not execute it.  The gathered information is stored in the WorkOrder.
   *   SetupExecution() is optional but typically required. It can bring up GUI elements to
   *   prompt the user for any necessary information.  SetupExecution() is not called when
   *   a WorkOrder is redone.
   *
   *   *execute*
   *   execute() needs to be implemented perform the WorkOrder.
   *   All information neccessary to run the WorkOrder should already be stored in the WorkOrder.
   *   The data necessary for the  WorkOrder can be retrieved via internalData()
   *   Execute() can not use any GUI elements. Each time a
   *   WorkOrder is redone execute() is called to redo the WorkOrder.
   *
   *   For synchronous WorkOrders the execute()
   *   method runs on the GUI thread and there are no special requirements on object ownership.
   *
   *   For asynchronous WorkOrders any memory allocations that aren't deallocated within
   *   execute() will need to be moved to the GUI thread.  @see ImportImagesWorkOrder::execute
   *   for an example of an asynchronous WorkOrder that allocates memory. setProgressValue()
   *   can be used to update the progress bar in the GUI. Any member variables being accessed by an
   *   asynchronous workorder will need to have a QMutex locker so they can be thread safe
   *
   *   *postExecution*
   *   postExecution() runs on the GUI thread so it should not perform any long running operations.
   *   It is intended for any cleanup or GUI updates after execute().  Typically it would only be
   *   needed for asynchronous WorkOrders where they need to update the GUI and do cleanup.  It is
   *   not required to implement this method.
   *
   *   *undoExecution*
   *   undoExecution() is only required for undoable WorkOrders.  undoExecution() should undo the
   *   effects of the execute() only using state stored in the
   *   WorkOrder.  It will run on the GUI thread if synchronous or a non-GUI thread if asynchronous.
   *   The same restrictions as execute() apply to this method.
   *
   *   *postUndoExecution()*
   *   This is not required. If needed, it should perform any cleanup after undoExecution().
   *   postUndoExecution() has the same restrictions as postExecution().
   *
   *   Other methods the WorkOrder may need to implement are:
   *
   *   *isExecutable(<various type>)*
   *   IsExecutable() determines if the WorkOrder should show up in the context menus (this has no
   *   bearing on how the main menu is populated).  Note that isExecutable will need to be
   *   implemented for each type of parameter this WorkOrder should show in the context menu.
   *
   *   *dependsOn*
   *   This is currently not implemented properly for most WorkOrders.  In theory this should determine
   *   if the workOrder parameter passed in must be completed prior to this workOrder completing.   Most
   *   current WorkOrders just check if the WorkOrder parameter is the same type.
   *
   *   *setCreatesCleanState*
   *   This is used to indicate the WorkOrder has set the state back to an unchanged state from which
   *   the project was originally opened.  This is used by open, save, and close project WorkOrders. Unlikely
   *   to be needed by other WorkOrders. This can needs to be set to false to be able to have an undoable
   *   workorder
   *
   *   *setModifiesDiskState*
   *   WorkOrders should call this to indicate they modify the disk state, this should be set to true to
   *   be able to have an undoable workorder.  The WorkOrder should implement the undoExecution method
   *   if this is set to true.

   *   @history 2012-08-23 Steven Lambright and Stuart Sides - Updated the class to be much more
   *                           flushed out. We now have WorkOrderStatus, syncRedo(), asyncRedo(),
   *                           postSyndRedo() (also undo versions), dependsOn(), full dependency
   *                           analysis, full progress/status strings, no more race conditions in
   *                           undo/redo, the work order list is now doubly-linked, and added
   *                           the statusChanged() signal. redo() and undo() should no longer cause
   *                           any bad or undesired behavior.
   *   @history 2012-09-19 Steven Lambright - Added QList<Control *> data support for in-memory
   *                           controls. I did not yet do the serialization because we're working
   *                           on a "ControlList" class that may encapsulate some of the
   *                           implementation (maybe, we'll see).
   *   @history 2012-10-19 Steven Lambright - Removed parent argument from constructor - deleting

   *                           work orders will work correctly when the associated images are
   *                           freed from memory and later re-allocated (the import of the images
   *                           was undone, for example). Added elapsed time value to the status text
   *                           and fixed warning for work orders without undo text.
   *                           Added listenForImageDestruction() and clearImageList().
   *   @history 2013-04-25 Jeannie Backer - Modified call to qWarning() to prevent compile warnings
   *                           on MAC OS 10.8.2
