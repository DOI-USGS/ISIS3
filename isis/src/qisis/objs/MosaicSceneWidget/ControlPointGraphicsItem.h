  /**
   * @brief The visual display of a single control point
   *
   * The control point tries to always draw itself at a constant size and
   *   uses the scene pointer to accomplish this.

   *   @history 2011-05-09 Steven Lambright - Fixed known issue with paint() when zoomed in.
   *   @history 2011-05-10 Steven Lambright - Added arrow capabilities, fixed problem with
   *                           boundingRect() that seemed to cause a crash.
   *   @history 2011-06-07 Debbie A. Cook and Tracie Sucharski - Modified point types
   *                           Ground ------> Fixed
   *                           Tie----------> Free
   *   @history 2013-01-02 Steven Lambright - Updated setArrowVisible() to support new coloring
   *                           options. The design of this configuration is wrong/needs fixed, but
   *                           I'm leaving it alone due to time constraints. Updated paint() method
   *                           to appropriately apply colors. Fixes #479.
   *   @history 2016-05-18 Ian Humphrey - Updated the control point crosses to be cosmetic so that
   *                           they always appear on screen (Qt4 to Qt5).
   *   @history 2016-10-20 Tracie Sucharski - Remove obsolete code that was commented out.
   *                           Fixes #4479.
   *   @history 2017-08-02 Tracie Sucharski - Draw the current edit Control Point as a circle with
   *                           center crosshair in red.  Fixes #5007, #5008.
   *   @history 2018-05-01 Kaitlyn Lee - Changed colors of control points to match qnet.
   *                           Colors Changed: free from blue to darkGreen, locked from magenta
   *                           to darkGreen, ignored from red to yellow,
   *                           and constrained (was dark green) and fixed (was green)
   *                           are now both represented with magenta. Fixes #5401.
