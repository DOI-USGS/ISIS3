   *   @history 2016-09-30 Tracie Sucharski - Pass in directory to constructor, so that we can
   *                           query for shapes and other data from the project.
   *   @history 2018-05-28 Kaitlyn Lee - Since AbstractProjectItemView now inherits
   *                           from QMainWindow, I added a dummy central widget
   *                           and set its layout to QVBoxLayout. We used to set
   *                           the whole CnetEditorView widget's layout, now we only
   *                           set the central widget's layout.
   *   @history 2018-06-13 Kaitlyn Lee - Removed toolbars, since they are not needed.
