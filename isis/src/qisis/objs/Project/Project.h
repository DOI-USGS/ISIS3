   * @brief The main project for ipce
   *
   * @author 2012-??-?? ???
   *
   * @internal
   *   @history 2012-07-27 Kimberly Oyama - Added comments to some of the methods.
   *   @history 2012-09-04 Tracie Sucharski - Renamed addCNets to addCnets, controlNetRoot to
   *                           cnetRoot, networkLoaded to cnetLoaded.  Added new method,
   *                           addCnetFolder.
   *   @history 2012-09-11 Tracie Sucharski - Added mutex accessor method.
   *   @history 2012-09-12 Tracie Sucharski - Implemented ControlList instead of QList<Control *>,
   *                          re-ordered some methods to match header order.
   *   @history 2012-09-12 Steven Lambright - Renamed imageList() to createOrRetrieveImageList(),
   *                           added imageList() and image().
   *   @history 2012-09-17 Steven Lambright - Reduced the time complexity of image() to log(n) from
   *                           n/2. This method is often called n times.
   *   @history 2012-09-17 Steven Lambright - Added crash detection/cleanup. Prompt is coded but
   *                           disabled (we'll find a good wording or handle recovery better when
   *                           we don't expect so many crashes during development).
   *   @history 2012-10-29 Steven Lambright and Stuart Sides - Added isTemporaryProject(). This is
   *                           useful for the import images to know if it should prompt the user to
   *                           save their project.
   *   @history 2013-05-14 Jeannie Backer - Used return status of c++ system() in the constructor
   *                           to verify that the call was successful.
   *   @history 2014-07-14 Kimberly Oyama - Updated to better meet programming standards. Added
   *                           support for correlation matrix.
   *   @history 2015-02-20 Jeannie Backer - Replaced BundleResults references with
   *                           BundleSolutionInfo and BundleStatistics references with BundleResults
   *                           due to class name changes.
   *   @history 2015-09-03 Jeannie Backer - Removed svn merge conflict comment lines. Removed call
   *                           to save BundleSolutionInfo as an xml file. Added hdf5 preliminary
   *                           serialization calls. Some ISIS coding standards improvements.
   *   @history 2015-10-14 Jeffrey Covington - Declared Project * as a Qt
   *                           metatype for use with QVariant.
   *   @history 2016-06-23 Tracie Sucharski - Added a member variable for active control network
   *                           and active image list, along with accessor methods.
   *   @history 2016-07-06 Tracie Sucharski - Changed the ImageReader to require footprints, because
   *                           ImageReader class was changed so that footprints are no longer
   *                           created if not required.
   *   @history 2016-07-06 Tracie Sucharski - Add import shape models to project.
   *   @history 2016-11-09 Tyler Wilson - Added try-catch blocks around reader.parse calls in
   *                           the open function, so that warnings/errors are output to the
   *                           warnings tab of the GUI instead of causing the application
   *                           to exit.  Fixes #4488.
   *   @history 2016-11-22 Tracie Sucharski - When saving a new project, if it is currently a
   *                           temporary project, save project name as the base pathname for the
   *                           project.
   *   @history 2016-12-02 Tracie Sucharski - Changed the the tag name in ::endElement from
   *                           "project" to "imageLists" and "shapeLists", so that images and shapes
   *                           are added to the project when their end tags are found instead of the
   *                           project end tag.
   *   @history 2016-12-29 Tracie Sucharski - Changed setActiveControl and setActiveImageList to
   *                           take a displayName instead of a Control/ImageList so that restoration
   *                           of Project which contains an active control/imageList can be used.
   *                           The only piece of info that can be saved to a project is the
   *                           displayName.
   *   @history 2017-02-06 Tracie Sucharski - When adding a work order to the project, check the
   *                           work order to determine if it should be put on the QUndoStack.
   *                           Fixes #4598.
   *   @history 2017-03-30 Tracie Sucharski - Cleaned up some documentation regarding last change.
   *   @history 2017-04-04 Makayla Shepherd - Updated addToProject to support the new WorkOrder
   *                           design. Fixes #4729.
   *   @history 2017-04-06 Tracie Sucharski - Added call to child WorkOrder::execute() even if it
   *                           a CleanState.
   *   @history 2017-04-16 Ian Humphrey - Added activeControlSet and activeImageListSet,
   *                           activeControlAndImageListSet signals. Added
   *                           checkActiveControlAndImageList slot. This facilitates enabling
   *                           the JigsawWorkOrder on the main window menu. Fixes #4749. Also,
   *                           modified addToProject so that not undoable work orders have their
   *                           redo called instead of execute.
   *   @history 2017-04-25 Ian Humphrey - Added checkControlsAndImagesAvailable() slot and
   *                           controlsAndImagesAvailble() signal. These are used by internally
   *                           by Project constructor to listen for when a control and image are
   *                           added, used externally by directory to enable the jigsaw work order
   *                           when a cnet and image are available in the project. Fixes #4819.
   *   @history 2017-05-02 Tracie Sucharski - Added saving and resoring of BundleSolutionInfo.
   *                           Fixes #4822.
   *   @history 2017-05-15 Tracie Sucharski - Moved creation of BundleSolutionInfo results folder to
   *                           JigsawDialog::acceptBundleResults.  It was in
   *                           Project::addBundleSolutionInfo which is called for both adding to the
   *                           project and reading a saved project (which already has the folder).
   *                           Backed out changes make for deciding whether to copy cube dn data
   *                           because this broke importing images.
   *   @history 2017-05-17 Tracie Sucharski - Changed activeControl and activeImageList methods to
   *                           return default values if project contains a single control and a
   *                           single image list.  Fixes #4867.
   *   @history 2017-07-13 Makayla Shepherd - Added the ability to change the name of image
   *                           imports, shape imports, and bundle solution info. Fixes #4855,
   *                           #4979, #4980.
   *   @history 2017-07-17 Cole Neubauer - Changed activeControl signal to emit a bool to be able
   *                           to slot a setEnabled(bool) call to a QAction. This was necessary to
   *                           reenable the CNet Tool when a control net is made active.
   *                           Fixes #5046.
   *   @history 2017-07-24 Cole Neubauer - Added isOpen, isClean, setClean, and clear functions to
   *                           allow for opening of a new project. Fixes #4969.
   *   @history 2017-07-27 Cole Neubauer - Added check before emmiting workOrderStarting()
   *                           Fixes #4715.
   *   @history 2017-07-27 Cole Neubauer - Added a workordermutex to be used in workorder accessors
   *                           Fixes #5082.
   *   @history 2017-08-02 Cole Neubauer - Made setClean emit a signal from undoStack. Fixes #4960
   *   @history 2017-08-03 Cole Neubauer - Parsed XML to remove leftover files not in project
   *                           Fixes #5046.
   *   @history 2017-08-08 Makayla Shepherd - Fixed a seg fault that occurs when trying to edit a
   *                           control net without having an active control net set. Fixes #5048.
   *   @history 2017-08-07 Cole Neubauer - Added functionality to switch between active controls and
   *                           ImageList Fixes #4567
   *   @history 2017-08-11 Cole Neubauer - Removed unnecessary code in controlClosed that was
   *                           a segfault causing. Fixes #5064
   *   @history 2017-08-11 Cole Neubauer - Updated documentation for setClean and isClean #5113
   *   @history 2017-08-11 Christopher Combs - Added addTemplates(), removeTemplate(),
   *                           addTemplateFolder(), templateRoot(), and m_templates as well as
   *                           serialization and structure for importing template filenames
   *                           Fixes #5086.
   *   @history 2017-09-13 Tracie Sucharski - Fixed problems with cleanup on temporary projects.
   *                           Remove shapes, controls, and results.
   *   @history 2017-09-26 Tracie Sucharski - Close Image cube in
   *                           ::addTargetsFromImportedImagesToProject and
   *                           ::addCamerasFromImportedImagesToProject.  Fixes #4955.
   *   @history 2017-10-04 Tracie Sucharski - Comment out connections for
   *                           addTargetsFromImportedImagesToProject and
   *                           addCamerasFromImportedImagesToProject.  This functionality needs to
   *                           be put into the asynchronous process of importing images for speed
   *                           and memory efficiency.  See ticket #5181.  Fixes #4955.
   *   @history 2017-10-16 Ian Humphrey - Modified activeControl() to check if any images have been
   *                           imported into the project before trying to set an active control
   *                           when there is only one control in the project. Fixes #5160.
   *   @history 2017-11-01 Tracie Sucharski - Added new member variable for the
   *                           new project root when a Save As is being executed.  Both the old and
   *                           new project roots are needed for copying files into the new project
   *                           folders. Also updated the project name based on the new project.
   *                           Fixes #4849.
   *   @history 2017-11-02 Tyler Wilson - Added support for opening Recent Projects from the
   *                           File Menu.  Fixes #4492.
   *   @history 2017-11-08 Ian Humphrey - Changed save() from a void to a bool return value. This
   *                           indicates if the save dialog (for a temp project) is successfully
   *                           saved (i.e. not cancelled). Fixes #5205.
   *   @history 2017-11-03 Christopher Combs - Added support for new Template and TemplateList
   *                           classes. Fixes #5117.
   *   @history 2017-11-13 Makayla Shepherd - Modifying the name of an ImageList, ShapeList or
   *                           BundeSolutionInfo on the ProjectTree now sets the project to
   *                           not clean. Fixes #5174.
   *   @history 2017-11-15 Cole Neubauer - Added a check if there was an arg for the command line
   *                           to avoid creation of new temp project if a user is opening one from
   *                           the command line #5222
   *   @history 2017-12-01 Adam Goins - Added the maxRecentProjects() function to return the max
   *                           number of recent projects to be displayed. Fixes #5216.
   *   @history 2017-12-05 Christopher Combs - Added support for TemplateEditorWidget and
   *                           TemplateEditViewWorkOrder. Fixes #5168. Also fixed issue with saving
   *                           a project before save as where isOpen was not set to true.
   *   @history 2017-12-08 Tracie Sucharski - Added public method to add an Image to the
   *                           idToImageMap.  This was needed to add Images from the results item.
   *                           We need to access the map when opening saved projects that contain
   *                           images from groups other than the main project data area.  This is
   *                           a temporary fix until the project and model/view is improved.
   *                           Corrected the setting of the project root when pening a project from
   *                           the command line. Removed m_projectPath, it is no longer needed since
   *                           m_projectRoot contains the correct path. References #5104.
   *   @history 2018-03-14 Ken Edmundson - Modified save method to reopen project if we are saving
   *                           a temporary project to ensure all project files are pointing to the
   *                           correct directory. Note that this is NOT ideal, particularly it the
   *                           project has many files.
   *   @history 2018-03-14 Tracie Sucharski - Call the appropriate workorder from the methods
   *                           activeControl and activeImageList when returning a default value.
   *                           This ensures that all the proper error checking is handled and
   *                           prevents duplicate code.
   *   @history 2018-03-23 Ken Edmundson - Modified loadBundleSolutionInfo method to add the
   *                           BundleSolutionInfo's output control id to the project member variable
   *                           m_idToControlMap.
   *   @history 2018-03-26 Tracie Sucharski - When setting a new active control do not close the old
   *                           active control net if it is still being viewed in a CnetEditorWidget.
   *                           References #5026.
   *   @history 2018-03-27 Tracie Sucharski - Removed the calls to work orders from activeImageList
   *                           and activeControl methods.  Additional errors checks needed for
   *                           default values that are not in work orders.  Fixes #5256.
   *   @history 2018-03-30 Tracie Sucharski - Added public slot, activeControlModified, which sets
   *                           the modified state on the active Control. This was done, so that a
   *                           Control knows if its control net has been modified. Also added
   *                           signal, discardActiveControlEdits if user does not want to save
   *                           edits.  This is needed for CnetEditorWidgets that are displaying
   *                           the modified active control, it will effectively close that
   *                           CnetEditorView and reload with the original control net.  It was
   *                           done this way because there is no easy way to reload a control net in
   *                           the CnetEditor widgets. When saving Project, if there is an active
   *                           control and it has been modified, write active control to disk.
   *                           Unfortunately this is done in 2 different places depending on whether
   *                           a project "Save" or "Save As" is being done.  If "Save As", a
   *                           modified active cnet is not written out to the original project only
   *                           to the new project, so this had to be done in
   *                           Control::copyToNewProjectRoot.  If simply saving current projct,
   *                           the write is done here in the save method.
   *  @history 2018-04-25 Tracie Sucharski - Fixed typo in XmlHandler::startElement reading
   *                           imported shapes from a project which caused the shapes to be put in
   *                           the wrong place on the project tree. Fixes #5274.
   *  @history 2018-06-06 Kaitlyn Lee - activeControlModified() calls setClean(false) to enable the save
   *                           button when the active control net is modified, i.e. a point is modified.
   *  @history 2018-06-14 Makayla Shepherd - Save and Save As now save the geometry and state of
   *                           the project.
   *  @history 2018-07-07 Summer Stapleton - Separated m_templates into m_mapTemplates and 
   *                           m_regTemplates to keep track of the two template types as well as 
   *                           adjusted logic to save these serparately into the .xml files in the 
   *                           project directory. Also added clean-up of unsaved templates at
   *                           project close in Project::clear().
   *  @history 2018-07-12 Summer Stapleton - Added hasTemplate() and hasCamera() and modified 
   *                           addCamera() and addTarget logic in order to determine if a targetBody
   *                           or a guiCamera already exist in a project. This allows cameras and 
   *                           targets to be created in ImportImagesWorkOrder only when needed 
   *                           rather than creating them for every image imported and then removing
   *                           them if not needed. Fixed segfault occuring on astrovm4 with larger 
   *                           imports. References #5460.
   *   @history 2018-07-12 Kaitlyn Lee - Changed activeControlModified() to cnetModified() and
   *                          removed the line m_activeControl->setModified(true) in cnetModified()
   *                          since this is now done in the CnetEditorWidget and it caused a seg
   *                          fault when no images were imported and a user tried to edit a cnet. I
   *                          changed this because when a user made changes to a cnet, even if it
   *                          was not the active, the active was the only one that was recognized as
   *                          being modified. This stopped any changes made to a nonactive cnet from
   *                          being saved and caused the active to be saved if a nonactive was
   *                          edited. Fixes #5414.
   *   @history 2018-07-13 Kaitlyn Lee - Added singal cnetSaved() so that the save net button goes
   *                          back to black after the cnet is saved. Added signal
   *                          activeControlModified() that is emitted in cnetModified() and is
   *                          connected to Directory. This stops views from being redrawn when
   *                          any cnet is modified. Only the active should cause this. Fixes #5396.
   *  @history 2018-07-26 Tracie Sucharski - Fixed history entry errors introduced during
   *                           the merge conflict resolution for PR #255.
