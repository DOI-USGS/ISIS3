   * @brief Tree model for control points and control measures
   *
   * This class represents a model that provides access to control points and
   * control measures in a tree-like fashion. The tree structure is designed
   * such that control points are parent nodes with control measures as
   * children (leaf) nodes.
   *
   * This class also provides functionality for the multi-threaded rebuilding
   * of the point-measure tree model structure, which is necessary when
   * certain types of changes are made to the underlying control network.
   *

   *   @history 2012-09-28 Kimberly Oyama - Changed member variables to be prefixed with "m_".
   *   @history 2017-07-25 Summer Stapleton - Removed the CnetViz namespace. Fixes #5054.
