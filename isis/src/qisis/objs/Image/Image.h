  /**
   * This represents a cube in a project-based GUI interface. The actual cube doesn't have to be
   *   open. This encapsulates ideas about an image such as it's footprint, it's cube, how it
   *   should be viewed, where it is on disk, etc. This class is designed to be semi-light weight -
   *   we should be able to have tens of thousands of these in memory without any issues (provided
   *   the Cube files aren't open - see closeCube()).

   * @internal
   *   @history 2011-05-11 Steven Lambright - Added accessors for data that is
   *                           complicated to get or expensive (i.e. Camera
   *                           statistics and the footprint).
   *   @history 2011-05-18 Steven Lambright - Fixed the second constructor
   *   @history 2012-10-02 Steven Lambright - Added support for camera statistics information that
   *                           used to be in CubeDisplayProperties (a class that no longer exists).
   *   @history 2012-10-04 Jeannie Backer Changed references to TableField
   *                           methods to lower camel case. Fixed history
   *                           entry indentation. Added padding to control
   *                           statements. References #1169.
   *   @history 2015-10-14 Jeffrey Covington - Declared Image * as a Qt
   *                           metatype for use with QVariant.
   *   @history 2014-09-05 Kimberly Oyama - Added the serialNumber() function which returns
   *                           the cube's serial number.
   *   @history 2015-09-05 Kenneth Edmundson - Added preliminary target body information
   *                           (re:  the member variables QString m_instrumentId (the instrument ID
   *                           of the image), SpiceInt * m_bodyCode (the NaifBodyCode value if it
   *                           exists in the labels), and QString m_spacecraftName
   *                           (the Spacecraft name associated with this image).
   *   @history 2016-06-22 Tyler Wilson - Added documentation to member functions/variables.
   *                           Fixes #3950.
   *   @history 2017-10-11 Summer Stapleton - Removed path to instrumentId and spacecraftName in
   *                           the startElement method. Fixes #5179.
   *   @history 2017-11-01 Tracie Sucharski - Changed copyToNewProjectRoot to handle Images that are
   *                           located outside of the import image directories such as the updated
   *                           Images from a bundle run.  To improve efficiency, return from method
   *                           if the project root has not changed. Fixes #4849.
   *   @history 2018-06-30 Ian Humphrey - Added observationNumber() method so anything that grabs
   *                           an Image ProjectItem can easily get both the serial number and
   *                           observation number now. References #497.
   *   @history 2018-07-02 Ian Humphrey - Changed serialNumber() implementation to follow how
   *                           observationNumber() is implemented. This ensures that any calls
   *                           after the first call to these methods are O(1) and are not
   *                           bottlenecekd by any file I/O that occurs in the Compose()
   *                           methods. References #497.
   *   @history 2018-10-03 Tracie Sucharski - Added constructor which takes cube and a calculated
   *                           footprint.  This was done for ipce imported shapes which do not
   *                           contain a footprint. References #5504.
