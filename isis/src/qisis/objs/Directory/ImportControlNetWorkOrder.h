   * @brief Add control networks to a project

   * Asks the user for a list of control nets and copies them into the project.

   * @internal
   *   @history 2012-09-11 Tracie Sucharski and Steven Lambright - Added asynchronous functionality
   *                           for redo.
   *   @history 2017-04-04 Makayla Shepherd - Combined syncRedo and asyncRedo into execute, changed
   *                           execute to setupExecution, and renamed postSyncRedo to postExecution
   *                           and undoSyncRedo to undoExecution. This was done to match the
   *                           WorkOrder redesign. Fixes #4716.
   *   @history 2017-05-01 Ian Humphrey - Updated undoExecution() so when undone, the imported
   *                           cnet(s) are removed from the project tree. Fixes #4597.
   *   @history 2017-07-25 Cole Neubauer - Added project()->setClean call Fixes #4969
   *   @history 2017-07-13 Makayla Shepherd - Added isExecutable(ProjectItem) to allow for importing
   *                           in the context menu. Fixes #4968.
   *   @history 2017-07-26 Makayla Shepherd - Fixed a crash that occurs when a failed image import
   *                           is undone. Fixes #5043.
   *   @history 2017-07-28 Cole Neubauer - Added a pointer to the project item added by the work
   *                           order. This pointer is used in the Undo funtions. #5064
   *   @history 2017-08-11 Cole Neubauer - Refactored import so it closes the controlNet after
   *                           Control is created Fixes #5026
   *   @histroy 2017-10-24 Adam Goins - Removed the undoStack() call that occurred when a
   *                           Failed cnet is imported. Fixes #5186
   *   @histroy 2018-06-13 Kaitlyn Lee - Removed undoExecution() because we should not want to undo
   *                           an import. In postExecution(), added the ability to set an active
   *                           control network when one control network is imported. Fixes #5440 #5389.
