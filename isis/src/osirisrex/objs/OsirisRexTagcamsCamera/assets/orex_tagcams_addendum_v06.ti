  This kernel is used by the ISIS software to supply required keywords for
  the ISIS camera models. This kernel is furnished to the NAIF SPICE pool as 
  one of the very last kernels. This allows it to overide keywords from other
  kernels.

  History:
  v01:
  2018-12-09 Kris Becker - Original version. Transformations from line/samp

  v02:
  2019-01-09 Kris Becker - Updated with new boresights, minor adjustments
                           to focal lengths from distortion model. Added
			   tangential distortion model.
  v03:
  2019-01-22 Kris Becker - Renamed the OpenCV parameters to better conform
                           and coorelate with the OpenCV calibration parameter
			   names. Added inital values of 0.0 for the additional
			   OpenCV k4-k6 parameters to complete the full
			   model definition.
  v4:
  2019-01-24 Kris Becker - TAGCAMS team provided new parameter for Navcam1
                           and Navcam2 OpenCV distortion models. See 
			   OIA_ORX_112_Distortion_Boresight_Memo.pdf.
  v5:
  2019-01-28 Kris Becker - Set the camera boresight to the center of the
                           optical distortion center as specifed by the
			   NAV team although this is currenty not used
			   by the camera models (uses CCD center as detector
			   reference) as defined by the IK.
  v6:
  2019-02-03 Kris Becker - Added spacecraft ordering and SPICE parameters to
                           handle light time and surface corrections. The
			   initial settings are for proximity of Bennu. This
			   assumes the distance to Bennu for imaging is very
			   short so we turn off light time correction. For
			   all conditions, we want to swap target/observer
			   for proper calls to NAIF toolkit to acquire SPICE
			   ephemeris (ISIS specific issue). For long distance
			   targets, such as EGA, you should consider setting
			   light time correction to 'LT+S'. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The coefficients below are for transforming focal plane X,Y (mm) to/from Line,
Sample. The numbers are from the CCD pixel pitch.

The following TRANS values are for ISIS cubes assuming no distortion
First pixel in the input file is line 1 sample 1, second pixel in the input file
is line 1 sample 2.

There are three different distortion models to choose from for the TAGCAMS
camera model:

OCAMS - This one is based upon the OCAMS model but requires the OPENCV
        parameters to be transformed into compatible parameters. Currently,
	only the NCMCam (Navcam 1) camera has had this done.

OPENCV - A direct implementation of the OPENCV stereo model as produced by
         the stereo calibration OPENCV routines. This is a 10 parameter model
	 where a single focal length is provided in the API (SIS3 doesn't
	 support focal lengths for each axis) and the temperature is
	 provided by the camera model as derived from data stored in 
	 the label.

NONE   - No distortion is applied.
