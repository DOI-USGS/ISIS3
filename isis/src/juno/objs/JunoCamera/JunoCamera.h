   * @brief Juno's JNC (JunoCam) camera model
   *
   * This is the camera model for the JunoCam instrument. This
   * instrument is technically a pushframe instrument, but it is treated as a
   * framing instrument. This is
   * also a more flexible camera model since it will make controlling the
   * individual framelets alot easier.
