/*
* DESCRIPTION
*   This module calcutes a "sequency" ordered, two dimensional
*   inverse Walsh-Hadamard transform (WHT) on 16 x 16 blocks of
*   data.  It is done as two one dimensional transforms (one of the
*   rows followed by one of the columns).  Each one dimensional
*   transform is implemented as a 16 point, 4 stage "butterfly".
*
* COMMENTARY
*  These routines have been highly optimized to produce very fast
*  32000 executable code but still use C for coding (thus allowing
*  compilation on other machines).

/*
* This defines a four input (and output), two stage "butterfly"
* calculation done completely in registers (once the data is read from
* memory.  Four input and two stages was picked to maximize the use of
* the 32000's registers.  Eight of these are required to do a 16 point,
* one dimensional WHT.  The "simple" formulas for this "butterfly" are:
*
*  n0 = i0 + i1
*  n1 = i0 - i1  First stage
*  n2 = i2 + i3
*  n3 = i2 - i3
*
*  o0 = n0 + n2
*  o1 = n1 + n3  Second stage
*  o2 = n0 - n2
*  o3 = n1 - n3
*
* All data (in and out) is assumed to be 16 bit integers.  "in" is the
* base address of the input data array and "ii" is the scaling factor to
* use on the next four indexes into "in" (this allows moving by rows or
* columns through a two dimensional array stored as a one dimensional set
* of numbers).  "i0", "i1", "i2", and "i3" are the unscaled indexes into
* "in".  "out" is the base address of the output data array and "oi" is
* the scaling factor to use on the next four indexes into "out" (this
* allows moving by rows or columns through a two dimensional array stored
* as a one dimensional set of numbers).  "o0", "o1", "o2", and "o3" are
* the unscaled indexes into "out".
