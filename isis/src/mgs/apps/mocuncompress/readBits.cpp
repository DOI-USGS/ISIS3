/*
    This is a low-level bit stream reader.  It's adapted from a version
    by Terry Ligocki with the SCCS id "@(#)readBits.c (readBits.c) 1.3".

    This version has been modified to read from memory rather than from
    a stdio stream; the old code is retained and can be used by defining
    FILEBITS at the top of readBits.h, but this HAS NOT BEEN TESTED.
    There are known problems with reading a block too far in this mode
    anyway.  Use with caution.
