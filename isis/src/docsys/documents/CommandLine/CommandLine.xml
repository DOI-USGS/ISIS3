        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
        This section describes how to run ISIS programs on the command line 
	instead of the GUI.  This is particularly useful 1) to setup shell 
	scripts or other batch job mechanisms to run a sequence of programs 
	on cubes or if 2) you prefer keyboarding over mousing.
        </p>

        <h2>Invoking a Program</h2>
        <p>
          To start an ISIS program, simply type its name, for example, <i>lowpass</i>.  
	  This starts the program under the GUI; however, if you provide anything 
	  after the program name, as in the example below, it is assumed the 
	  program is running in command line mode.
        </p>


<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
lowpass from=moon.cub to=moon.lpf.cub lines=5 samples=5 minimum=1
</pre>

        <p>
          The program will immediately attempt to run and if parameters are 
	  missing or wrong, an error will be output.  Example:
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
lowpass from=moon.cub lines=4 samples=5 minimum=1

  Group = Error
    Program = lowpass
    Class   = "USER ERROR"
    Code    = 2
    Message = "Parameter [TO] must be entered"
    File    = IsisAml.cpp
    Line    = 2867
  End_Group

lowpass from=moon.cub to=moon.lpf.cub lines=4 samples=5 minimum=1

  Group = Error
    Program = lowpass
    Class   = "USER ERROR"
    Code    = 2
    Message = "Value for [LINES] must be odd"
    File    = IsisAml.cpp
    Line    = 2357
  End_Group
</pre>

        <h2>Application Specific Parameters</h2>
        <p>
          All ISIS command lines take the following form:
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
program parameter1=value parameter2=value ...parameterN=value
</pre>

        <p>
          The parameters can be entered in any order, can be abbreviated so 
	  long as they are unique, are case insensitive, and can be omitted 
	  if they have a default value.  The values can be integers, doubles, 
	  strings, or booleans, and homogenous arrays 
	  of these types.  
        </p>

<p>
Display the <i>lowpass</i> GUI from the command line or use the -help reserved 
parameter to see the parameter names that are available for the program.
Simply type "lowpass" to display the GUI, or type the command "lowpass -h" to 
display the parameter names necessary to run a particular ISIS program on the 
command line.  The default values are shown below, to the right of the equal 
sign.  The results of the two methods shown below can be used as a guide to 
construct the commands on the command line.

<p>
Below are examples of constructing a command line using the GUI or the parameter
list shown above as a guide:
</p>
<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
Example1: lowpass f=moon.cub t=moon.lpf.cub s=5 l=5 minimum=1
Example2: lowpass f=moon.cub t=moon.lpf.cub s=5 li=5 minimum=1
Example3: lowpass f=moon.cub t=moon.lpf.cub s=5 lin=5
</pre>

        <p>
          Example 1 would fail because "l" could represent the parameters 
	  <def link="Line">lines</def>, 
	  low, <def link="LRS">lrs</def>, or <def link="LIS">lis</def>.
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
lowpass f=moon.cub t=moon.lpf.cub s=5 l=5 minimum=1
**USER ERROR** Invalid command line
**USER ERROR** Parameter [l] is not unique.
</pre>
        <p>
          Example 2 would fail because "li" could represent the parameter 
	  <def link="Line">lines</def> or <def link="LIS">lis</def>.
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
lowpass f=moon.cub t=moon.lpf.cub s=5 li=5 minimum=1
**USER ERROR** Invalid command line
**USER ERROR** Parameter [li] is not unique.
</pre>

        <p>
          Example 3 would execute successfully because all the parameters provided
	  by the user are unique. The parameter <b>minimum</b> is not required 
	  because the default value has been used.  When the default value is not 
	  used for a specific parameter, then it must be specified.  Also note this
	  example shows that the parameters are case insensitive and the parameters 
	  may occur in any order.
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
lowpass S=5 LIN=5 F=moon.cub T=moon.lpf.cub
Working
100% Processed
</pre>
        <h2>Integer and Double Parameters</h2>
        <p>
          The documentation for each application indicates the valid data type 
	  of each parameter.  The examples below show the values entered as
	  an Integer for samples and a Double for minimum:
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
samples=5
minimum=0.679
</pre>

        <p>
          Often there will be error checks performed by the application to ensure 
	  the values entered are valid.  Example:
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
lowpass f=moon.cub t=moon.lpf.cub s=0 lin=5

  Group = Error
    Program = lowpass
    Class   = "USER ERROR"
    Code    = 2
    Message = "Parameter [SAMPLES] must be greater than or equal to [1]"
    File    = IsisAml.cpp
    Line    = 2205
  End_Group
</pre>

        <p>
          Similarly, paired parameters used to specify minimum and maximum
	  values are verified so that the low value parameters do not exceed 
	  the high value parameters.
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
lowpass f=moon.cub t=moon.lpf.cub s=5 lin=5 low=5 hi=3

**USER ERROR** Invalid command line.
**USER ERROR** Parameter [hi] is not unique.

lowpass f=moon.cub t=moon.lpf.cub s=5 lin=5 low=5 high=3

  Group = Error
    Program = lowpass
    Class   = "USER ERROR"
    Code    = 2
    Message = "Parameter [LOW] must be less than parameter [HIGH]"
    File    = IsisAml.cpp
    Line    = 2623
  End_Group
</pre>


        <h2>String Parameters</h2>
        <p>
          String parameters can be slightly more complicated because of operating 
	  system intricacies.  The difference is in one word strings versus multiple 
	  word strings.  The command line parsing has been improved to handle escape 
	  sequences and support arrays better for strings.  The equation parser is 
	  case insensitive, ignores whitespace, and converts all braces to 
	  parentheses.  Parameter values, when quoted, no longer need the quotes 
	  escaped.  Please note that the dollar sign ($) still requires a backslash 
	  for batchlist variables.
	</p>

      <p>
	The command line syntax changes are as follows (with TCSH/BASH examples):
      </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
TCSH/BASH 
Before: 
     crop from=\"some file.cub\" to=\"output file.cub\"
Now:    
     crop from="some file.cub" to="output file.cub"
</pre>

  
      <p>
	  Array values, for programs such as <i>spiceinit</i>, will be the same. 
      </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
TCSH
Before: 
     spiceinit from=input.cub ck='(file1.cub,file2.cub)'
Now:    
     spiceinit from=input.cub ck='(file1.cub,file2.cub)'

BASH:
Before: 
     spiceinit from=input.cub ck='(file1.cub,file2.cub)'
Now:    
     spiceinit from=input.cub ck='(file1.cub,file2.cub)'
</pre>

      <p>   
	An escape character "\" has been added to differentiate a first parenthesis 
	from the beginning of an array sequence.
      </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
TCSH
Before: 
     fx equation='"(1+2)/2"'
Now:    
     fx equation='\(1+2)/2'

BASH
Before: 
     fx equation='"(1+2)/2"'
Now:    
     fx equation=\(1+2)/2
</pre>
	
      <p>
	The equation string entered within a GUI interface may not work if the 
	entire string is copied, pasted, and executed at the command line. If the first 
	character in the equation is a "(" then it must be prefixed by a "\" 
	when executing as a command line, but the remaining parentheses do not
	need to be prefixed with a backslash.
      </p>

      <p>
	Example: 
      </p>

      <p> This equation string works inside the <i>fx</i> GUI: </p>
<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
fx f1=BIFQF23N004_D218_T069S02_V02_I3.cub to=tt.cub equation=(f1*(f1>.004)) 
</pre>

      <p>These equation strings fail on the command line: </p> 
<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
fx f1=BIFQF23N004_D218_T069S02_V02_I3.cub to=tt.cub equation=(f1*(f1>.004)) 
fx f1=BIFQF23N004_D218_T069S02_V02_I3.cub to=tt.cub equation="(f1*(f1>.004))" 
</pre>

      <p>
	This equation string works on the command line: </p>
<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
fx f1=BIFQF23N004_D218_T069S02_V02_I3.cub to=tt.cub equation="\(f1*(f1>.004))"
</pre>
      
      <p>
        Other miscellaneous command lines which are not proper 
	will no longer work, such as the following command,
	where space is used as an argument:</p>
	
<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
spiceinit from=input.cub " "
</pre>

      <p>
	Multiple spaces in strings are detected better now and properly identified 
	on a command line.  Although spaces are detected better, it is recommended 
	that file names and directory names do not contain spaces especially if 
	batch processing will be utilized in subsequent processing steps. <br /><br />
	TCSH/BASH <br/>
	Before: 
	</p>
<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
tabledump from=input.cub name=\"some  table\"
</pre>
      <p>
	Now: 
      </p>
<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
tabledump from=input.cub name="some table" 
tabledump from=input.cub name="some  table" 
</pre>
      <p>
	Note the first example shows a single space between "some" and "table" 
	and the second example shows two spaces between "some" and "table."
       </p>

 
 <h2>Special Characters</h2>

 <p>
  When running an ISIS application from the command line, there may be conflicts
  with the syntax between ISIS and the shell (e.g., bash, tcsh).  ISIS commands 
  can use characters that the shell reserves for special  actions; therefore,
  in order for ISIS to get the correct string, certain characters must be escaped 
  to derive the correct meaning.
  </p>
  <p> 
  Here are some special shell characters that must be escaped when using ISIS
  commands on the command line:
  </p>
<pre>
   ? $ ' ` " * ( ) { } \
</pre>
<p>  
 <ul>
 <li>
  The backslash ( \ ) will escape a single special character; this means the 
  shell will treat a special character with a backslash in front of it as a 
  literal character. 
 </li>
 <li>
  The single or double quotes provide cleaner syntax when there are multiple 
  characters to escape. The single quotes are the strongest type of escape; 
  every special character is treated as a normal character when it is bound 
  by single quotes. 
 </li>
 <li>
  Double quotes, on the other hand, only escape some of the special characters.
 </li>
 <li>
  The single quote, double quote, and the backslash have similar functions 
  in the shell.
 </li>
 <li>
  The dollar sign ($) and back quote (`) retain their special meaning. This 
  allows command and variable expansion. In bash the backslash (\) also retains 
  its meaning. However, in tcsh it is escaped. Bash allows you to nest quotes 
  but tcsh does not. 
 </li>
 </ul>
</p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
For example, if ISISROOT = /home/checkout/isis, the command

     echo "$ISISROOT"

returns 

     /home/checkout/isis.

However, the commands

     echo '$ISISROOT' and echo \$ISISROOT

return 
     
     $ISISROOT.
</pre>

 <p>
  When using the command line, escape characters may be necessary to 
  generate the correct ISIS string. Escape characters will not cause program 
  errors because ISIS ignores them. 
 </p>

 <p>
  The dollar sign ($) signifies a variable as shown in the first example of 
  this section. The $( ) pair is used for command expansion and $((expression)) 
  is used for arithmetic expansion. The parentheses are also used to separate 
  tokens and change the order of precedence, parentheses execute first. The ${ } 
  pair is used for parameter expansion. The curly braces ({ }) denote reserved 
  words.
</p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
For example,

     echo ${ISISROOT}

will result in

     /home/checkout/isis
</pre>

 <p>
  The dollar sign ($) is also used to represent the last line in certain 
  pattern matching situations. For instance, 3-$ means to begin an action at 
  line 3 and to keep going with that particular action until the end of the 
  file is reached. 
</p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
sed '3-$d' filename.txt
</pre>

<p>
 The dollar sign ($) can also be followed by a number. ISIS ignores dollar 
 signs unless the batchlist parameter is used. See the "-BATCHLIST PARAMETER"
 section for more information. 
</p>

<p>
 Another very common special character used in ISIS scripts is the question 
 mark (?). The shell interprets this as any single character. The question 
 mark can be used when there are multiple strings to read or write. ISIS on 
 the other hand, replaces the question mark (?) with a single integer 
 starting at one and continues for the number of digits represented by 
 question marks. For example, to create the 
 <def link="Control Point">control point IDs</def> of a 
 <def link="Control Network">control network</def>, in sequential order, 
 and to append numbers to a string prefix termed "newpoint," do the following:
</p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
pointid="newpoint????"
</pre>

 <p>
  This will give each new <def link="Control Point">control point</def> a 
  unique, sequential name: newpoint0001, newpoint0002, and so on up to 4 
  digits or up to the number of points in the 
  <def link="Control Network">control network</def> file.  The numbering
  starts with 1.
</p>

 <p>
   Since the shell processes the special characters in the command before 
   passing it to the ISIS application, something like the pointid example 
   above, without the quotes, would fail because the shell would try to find 
   a file name beginning with "newpoint" followed by exactly four other 
   characters. It probably would not find anything and would result in an 
   error. So, what we want is for ISIS to get the "newpoint????" string including 
   the unprocessed question marks. ISIS will then replace the question marks 
   with sequential integers. Because there is one level of processing being 
   done by the shell before the command is passed to ISIS you can use any of 
   the following to get the same result:
</p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
pointid='newpoint????'

pointid="newpoint????"

pointid=newpoint\?\?\?\?
</pre>

 <p>
  The asterisk (*) is also used in many ISIS scripts. The shell will replace 
  the asterisk (*) with any number of characters that complete the string to 
  fit the pattern. The following example shows a directory's contents, and 
  then the use of the wildcard, aka the asterisk, to list specific filenames.  
</p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
Current directory contents:

moon_a.cub
mars.cub
moon.cub
winter_storm.jpg
moon.jpg
starMoon.cub
</pre>
<p>
 Command to make an input list of all filenames that begin with moon, and
 have the extension .cub:
</p>
<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
ls moon*.cub > inputList.lis
</pre>
<p>
 If you view the contents of <b>inputList.lis</b> file, then it should 
 contain the following:
</p>
 
<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
moon_a.cub
moon.cub
</pre>

 <p>
A very important difference between the asterisk ( * ) and the question mark ( ? ) 
is that the asterisk will not work as part of an output string like "newpoint????" 
because it is ambiguous. It will not auto-generate a string to match the pattern.
</p>

 <p>
The following command will give an error in both bash and tcsh:
</p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
Current directory contents:

a.lis
b.lis
c.lis
</pre>

<p>
Command to create a list and pump its contents into a ".lis" file using a 
wildcard:
</p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
ls > *.lis

Resulting error:

*.lis: ambiguous
</pre>

 <p>
  The asterisk (*) can be escaped with the backslash(\), single quotes('), 
  or double quotes("), just like the question mark.
</p>

 <p>
   The back quote (`), often used in test scripts, are different from double 
   quotes. Instead of escaping its contents, the back quotes cause the 
   encompassed command to be executed and the results of that command will 
   replace the quoted string. The back quotes are special characters that 
   retain special meaning in double quotes, but this is not the case with 
   single quotes. 
</p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
For example, when the directory contents are

test_a
test_b
test_c

and the following command(s) are executed
  
  echo `ls test*` and echo "`ls test*`"

both will result in following:

test_a
test_b
test_c

Whereas the following command(s)
  
  echo "ls tests*" or echo 'ls tests*'

would result in

  ls tests*
</pre>


        <h2>Lists of String Parameters</h2>
        <p>
          Some applications will restrict the values of string parameters to a 
	  pre-defined list.  We will use the <i>raw2isis</i> GUI below as a guide for
	  the examples.  In this particular case, both 
	  <def link="Bit Type">BITTYPE</def> and <def link="Byte">BYTEORDER</def> 
	  are strings restricted to certain values.  Those values are given in 
	  parentheses to the right of the radio buttons in the GUI.  Two examples follow.
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
raw2isis byteorder=lsb bittype=real from=file.raw to=file.cub line=500 sample=500
raw2isis byteorder=lsb bittype=R from=file.raw to=file.cub lin=500 samp=500
</pre>
        <p>
          When radio buttons appear in the GUI, the value can be abbreviated to 
	  uniqueness and is case insensitive as well.  The second example, 
	  bittype=R implies bittype=real.  The following example would fail 
	  because the string "unsigned" for the bittype parameter is not unique
	  for the options UnsignedByte and UnsignedWord:
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
raw2isis bittype=unsigned from=file.raw to=file.cub line=500 samp=500

  Group = Error
    Program = raw2isis
    Class   = "PROGRAMMER ERROR"
    Code    = 3
    Message = "Value of [BITTYPE] does not match a list option uniquely"
    File    = IsisAml.cpp
    Line    = 2188
  End_Group
</pre>

        <h2>Boolean Parameters</h2>
        <p>
          These parameters are represented by check boxes in the GUI.  Command 
	  line examples of the use of a boolean parameter are
        </p>
	
<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
foobar option=yes
foobar option=no
foobar option=true
foobar option=false
foobar option=t
foobar option=f
</pre>
        <p>
          The values are case insensitive.  That is, Yes, YES, True, T, etc. work as well.
        </p>

        <h2>Inclusive and Exclusive Parameters</h2>
        <p>
          The GUI has the ability to include or exclude parameters via stipling 
	  (graying out parameters). The application programs will throw an error 
	  if certain parameters are incorrectly included or excluded when executing 
	  a command in command line mode.  See the following <i>grid</i> example, 
	  and notice the user errors:
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
grid from=0145r_cal.cub to=gridtest.cub baseline=10 basesamp=20

   Group = Error
    Program = grid
    Class   = "USER ERROR"
    Code    = 2
    Message = "Parameter [BASELINE] can not be entered if parameter [MODE] is
               equal to [GROUND]"
    File    = IsisAml.cpp
    Line    = 2736
  End_Group
</pre>
<p>
If the <i>grid</i> GUI is used, the parameters baseline and basesample would be grayed 
out and the user would not be allowed to define them; however, if the command line 
mode is used then the error check is performed when the program is executed.  The
parameter "mode" must be set to "image" to use "baseline" and "basesample" parameters.
The example below shows the correct usage:
</p>
<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
grid from=0145r_cal.cub to=gridtest.cub baseline=10 basesamp=20 mode=image
</pre>

        <h2>Cube Attributes</h2>
        <p>
          When a parameter is an input or output <def link="Cube">cube</def>, the 
	  GUI presents two extra buttons (1) file selection [dir] and (2) additional options [att].  
	  The file selection [dir] dialog button is not implemented in the command 
	  line mode.  However, the additional attribute options shown in the GUI are fully 
	  implemented for both the input and output cube.  The selected options can 
	  be appended to the filename on the command line.
        </p>

        <h3>Output Cube Attributes</h3>
        <p>
          Below are examples of properties of an output <def link="Cube">cube</def> that 
	  users may specify:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Pixel Type</li>
          <li>Output Pixel Range</li>
          <li>Label Format</li>
          <li>Pixel Storage Order</li>
          <li>Storage Format</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          On the command line, the user supplements the output parameter with the attributes
	  as shown in the examples below:
        </p>

        <h4>Pixel Type</h4>
        <p>
          This defines the output pixel type.  There are three types of output pixels:  
	  UnsignedByte, SignedWord, and Real.  Valid values and synonyms are given below:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>+UnsignedByte</li>
          <li>+8bit</li>
          <li>+8-bit</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>+SignedWord</li>
          <li>+16bit</li>
          <li>+16-bit</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>+Real</li>
          <li>+32-bit</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The default value depends upon the type of program used.  Most geometry-like 
	  programs such as <i>crop</i>, <i>rotate</i>, <i>cam2map</i>, and <i>pad</i>, 
	  will simply propagate the input pixel type.  Programs which use pixel values 
	  such as <i>derive</i>, <i>highpass</i>, and <i>grad</i> will generally 
	  output real pixels.
        </p>

        <h4>Output Pixel Range</h4>
        <p>
          When choosing an output pixel type other than Real/32-bit, the user must 
	  define the expected range of output pixels.  The form is +minimum:maximum.  
	  See the following application using the application <i>moccal</i>:
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
moccal to=cal.cub+0.0:0.3
</pre>

        <p>
          It is important to select a good minimum and maximum <def link="Digital Number">DN
	  value</def> for the valid range.  If the window is too 
	  tight, pixels in the output file will be saturated (many <def>LRS</def> or 
	  <def>HRS</def> <def link="Special Pixels">special pixels</def>).  If 
	  the window is too wide, then quantization can occur.  That is, all the pixels are 
	  mapped to one value in the output <def link="Cube">cube</def>.  It can be a difficult 
	  problem that can be alleviated by outputting real images, understanding that 
	  the sacrifice is utilizing more disk space.
        </p>

        <h4>Label Format</h4>
        <p>
          The option exists to create attached or detached labels.  The complete 
	  word must be used.  The default option is read from the system-wide/user 
	  IsisPreference file.  See the following example using the application <i>crop</i>:
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
crop from=input.cub to=output.cub+detached
crop from=input.cub to=output.cub+attached
</pre>

        <p>
          Detached labels will be put in a separate file with an .lbl extension. 
        </p>

        <h4>Pixel Storage Order</h4>
        <p>
          The two formats, lsb and msb are for least and most significant 
	  <def link="Byte">byte</def> orders respectively.  The default is to use 
	  the format native to the machine's architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
          The output Byte order of 16-bit and 32-bit pixels can be selected in the 
	  following manner:
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
crop from=input.cub to=output.cub+lsb
crop from=input.cub to=output.cub+msb
</pre>


        <h4>Storage Format</h4>
        <p>
          The storage format of the file can be tile or band sequential.  The 
	  default format is tile, which is preferable for most geometric 
	  processing programs.  To select the format use
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
lowpass from=input.cub to=output.cub+tile
lowpass from=input.cub to=output.cub+bsq
lowpass from=input.cub to=output.cub+bandSequential
</pre>
        <p>
          Combining the cube attributes
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
lowpass from=input.cub to=output.cub+bandSequential+detached
</pre>

        <p>
          creates a band sequential output file and a detached label file that can be 
	  easily imported into other image processing packages.  The ISIS output
	  <def link="Cube">cube</def> file must be converted to a raw file or another 
	  format that non-ISIS applications can read.
        </p>

        <h3>Input Cube Attributes</h3>
        <p>
          Input <def link="Cube">cube</def> attributes are significantly less complicated 
	  than those of output.  They allow the user to select the <def link="Band">bands</def>
	  on which to operate.  The example below divides all bands by band 5:
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
ratio num=input.cub den=input.cub+5 to=dividebyband5.cub
</pre>

        <p>
          There are several forms of <def link="Band">band</def> selection:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>+singleBand</li>
            <li>+startBand-endBand</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The selections can be combined by comma separation.  Below are several 
	  examples of selecting bands:
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
+9
+3-5
+3,8,10-12
+3-1
+8,4,2
</pre>

        <h2>Reserved Parameters</h2>
        <p>
          All ISIS applications have a suite of reserved parameters that can be specified.  
	  The options are listed below:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>-webhelp, -help or -help=parameterName</li>
          <li>-last</li>
          <li>-restore=file</li>
          <li>-gui</li>
          <li>-nogui</li>
          <li>-batchlist=file</li>
          <li>-errlist=file</li>
          <li>-onerror=abort | continue</li>
          <li>-preference=file</li>
          <li>-log or -log=file</li>
          <li>-info or -info=file</li>
          <li>-save or -save=file</li>
          <li>-verbose</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
           These parameters may be typed out in full or until the command is distinct.  For instance:
        </p>
<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
equalizer -pref=myPreferences -s=ttt -g
equalizer -l
</pre>
	<p>
          The first command line is acceptable because each parameter is distinct.  
	  However, the second command line would cause an error.  The -l could 
	  have been intended to be the -last or -log parameter.  In this case, the 
          -l must be extended to -lo for log or -la for last.  If you choose to 
	  use the shortened version of the parameters, be sure to watch for 
	  conflicts of this sort.
        </p>

        <h3>-webhelp and -help  Parameters</h3>
        <p>
          This parameter is used to obtain help on the program.  Typing the 
	  <b>-webhelp</b> parameter will launch a browser containing the 
	  documentation for the application.  Typing the <b>-help</b> 
	  parameter will give a list of the programs parameters with their 
	  default value.  All the possible options will be output to the screen, 
	  and there will be a * placed before the default option if an option can 
	  be selected from more than one available options.  
	  Typing <b>-help=<i>parameterName</i></b> will give a brief description 
	  of the parameter, its default value, inclusion/exclusion information, 
	  and any other information provided in the program documentation.  The 
	  three possible options and the resulting output are provided below:
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
equalizer -webhelp
</pre>
        <p>
           The command above will cause a web browser to be launched with the 
	   documentation for the <i>equalizer</i> program.
        </p>
<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
equalizer -help
</pre>
        <p>
           The command above will cause the following terminal output to appear 
	   on the screen:
        </p>
<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
FROMLIST    = Null
HOLDLIST    = Null
TOLIST      = Null
OUTSTATS    = Null
INSTATS     = Null
PROCESS     = (*BOTH, CALCULATE, APPLY)
SOLVEMETHOD = (QRD, *SPARSE)
ADJUST      = (*BOTH, BRIGHTNESS, CONTRAST, GAIN)
MINCOUNT    = 1000
WEIGHT      = FALSE
PERCENT     = 100.0
</pre>
         <p>
           To gain more information on the ADJUST parameter, the following command can be used:
         </p>
<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
equalizer -help=ADJUST
</pre>
          <p>
             This command will cause the following terminal output to appear on the screen:
          </p>
<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
ParameterName = ADJUST
Brief         = "Algorithm type used to adjust the pixel values"
Type          = string
Default       = BOTH

Group = BOTH
  Brief = "Adjust the brightness and contrast of the images."
End_Group

Group = BRIGHTNESS
  Brief = "Adjust the brightness of the images using calculated offsets"
End_Group

Group = CONTRAST
  Brief = "Adjust the contrast of the images only using calculated gains"
End_Group

Group = GAIN
  Brief = "Adjust the contrast of the images without normalization"
End_Group
</pre>

        <h3>-last Parameter</h3>
        <p>
          This parameter will run the program using the parameter settings from 
	  the previous program run, if a parameter file exists 
	  (<b>programName.par</b>).  Example:
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
highpass -last
</pre>

        <p>
          Additionally, parameters can be modified in the following manner:
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
highpass -last from=next.cub to=next.hpf.cub
</pre>

        <h3>-restore Parameter</h3>
        <p>
          This parameter allows the user to run the programs with the parameters from 
	  a file.  In particular, a file saved using the GUI save mode or a session 
	  log.  Example:
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
highpass -restore=guiSave.par
</pre>

        <p>
          Either will look for the last occurrence of Group=UserParameters in 
	  Object=highpass in the specified file.  Parameter values will be loaded 
	  from that group.
        </p>

        <h3>-gui Parameter</h3>

        <p>
          This parameter invokes the GUI.  Other parameter names and values
	  specified by the user are also loaded into the GUI.  It can be used in 
	  combination with parameters and reserved parameters.
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
highpass from=input.cub to=output.cub lines=5 -gui
highpass -last -gui
</pre>


        <p>
          All examples cause the GUI to be shown with the values filled into the 
	  appropriate fields, but does not execute the program.
        </p>

        <h3>-nogui Parameter</h3>

        <p>
          This parameter forces the GUI not to run.  Its main intention is to be 
	  used on a program with no parameters.  For example,
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
csspck2spk -nogui
</pre>

        <h3>-batchlist Parameter</h3>

        <p>
          This parameter allows the user to run a program multiple times on a list 
	  of input parameters.  It can be used in combination with all parameters,
	  except -last, -restore, and -gui reserved parameters.  The batch list 
	  file must be a text file containing one or more columns of data.  The 
	  columns are referred to in the command line by using a '\$' followed by 
	  the column number. Below is an example of the contents of a batch list 
	  file <b>batchList.txt</b>:
        </p>
<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
/work2/eribelin/viking/   f387a06.cub
/work2/eribelin/viking/   f348b26.cub
/work2/eribelin/viking/   f319b19.cub
</pre>
        <p>
	   Below is a command line using a batch list file where the 
	   contents of the file will be substituted for $1 (column 1) and $2 
	   (column 2) upon execution of the <i>highpass</i> program:
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
highpass -batchlist=batchList.txt from=\$1\$2 to=\$1/hpf/\$2 lines=5 samples=5
</pre>

        <p>
          The command lines that would be constructed and executed from the above 
	  command are shown below:
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
highpass from=/work2/eribelin/viking/f387a06.cub to=/work2/eribelin/viking/hpf/f387a06.cub lines=5 samples=5
highpass from=/work2/eribelin/viking/f348b26.cub to=/work2/eribelin/viking/hpf/f348b26.cub lines=5 samples=5
highpass from=/work2/eribelin/viking/f319b19.cub to=/work2/eribelin/viking/hpf/f319b19.cub lines=5 samples=5
</pre>

        <h3>-errlist Parameter</h3>

        <p>
          This parameter will save the lines from the batch list file that failed
	  to execute to an error file in addition to writing the errors to the screen.  
	  It can be used in combination with all parameters, and the -batchlist and 
	  -onerror reserved parameters.  All lines that did not run successfully will 
	  be propagated to the error file.
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
highpass -batchlist=batchList.txt from=\$1\$2 to=\$1/hpf/\$2 lines=5 samples=5 -errlist=errList.txt
</pre>
        <p>
          The error list can be read back in as the batch list file once the 
	  errors are corrected as shown below:
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
highpass -batchlist=errList.txt from=\$1\$2 to=\$1/hpf/\$2 lines=5 samples=5 -errlist=errList2.txt
</pre>

        <h3>-onerror Parameter</h3>

        <p>
          This parameter can be used with all parameters, and the -batchlist and 
	  -errlist reserved parameters.  If the <b>continue</b> option is selected, 
	  it allows the user to run the program on all the files in the batch
	  list file without stopping until all the command lines are executed. Any
	  errors that were encountered are reported to the error list file.  If
	  the <b>abort</b> option is selected or it is run without being set 
          (the default is <b>abort</b>), the program will halt when the first error 
	  occurs.
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
highpass -batchlist=batchList.txt from=\$1\$2 to=\$1/hpf/\$2 lines=5 samples=5 -onerror=continue
</pre>
        <p>
          In this example, any errors that occur will be printed out to the screen 
	  and the program will continue to the next command.  The only record 
	  of the failures will be in the <b>print.prt</b> file.
        </p>

        <h3>-preference Parameter</h3>

        <p>
          This parameter can be used with all parameters, and reserved parameters.  
	  It overrides some of the settings in the current or default preference file
          with the contents of the file input by the user.  For example:
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
highpass from=input.cub to=output.cub lines=5 samples=5 -preference=myHighpassPrefs
</pre>
        <p>
          In this example, anything currently in the preference file will be overridden 
	  with the preferences in the file <b>myHighpassPrefs</b>.
        </p>

        <h3>-log Parameter</h3>

        <p>
          This parameter can be used with all parameters including the reserved 
	  parameters.  It overrides the current log file in the preferences with 
	  the file input by the user.  If the -preference option is also used, the 
	  log file entered will override the session log loaded in the preference 
	  file.  When -log is used without specifying a filename, the session log 
	  will be saved to the <b>print.prt</b> file.  If the session log output is turned 
	  off in the preferences, using the -log option will override it.  
	  Examples of each use follow.
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
highpass from=input.cub to=output.cub lines=5 samples=5 -log
highpass from=input.cub to=output.cub lines=5 samples=5 -log=temp.prt
</pre>
        <p>
          In the first example, the session log will be saved in the <b>print.prt</b> 
	  file in the current directory (even if the session log output is turned off 
	  in the default preferences file). In the second example, the current session 
	  log file in the preference file will be overridden with <b>temp.prt</b>, and 
	  the session log information will be saved there.
        </p>

        <h3>-info Parameter</h3>

        <p>
          This parameter can be used with all parameters including the reserved 
	  parameters.  It gathers debugging information necessary to help the ISIS 
	  developers determine if the program failure is due to user error or a 
	  program bug. When the -info is used without specifying a filename, 
          the debugging information will be displayed on the screen through standard 
	  output.  <span class="warning">PLEASE NOTE: The user should remove any 
	  data from this file that should not be made publicly available before 
	  posting the file on the ISIS Support Forums.</span>  Examples of each 
	  use follow.
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
highpass from=input.cub to=output.cub lines=5 samples=5 -info
highpass from=input.cub to=output.cub lines=5 samples=5 -info=debug.log
</pre>
        <p>
          In the first example, the debugging information will be output to the
	  screen.  In the second example, the debugging information will be written 
	  to <b>debug.log</b>.
        </p>

        <h3>-save Parameter</h3>

        <p>
          This parameter can be used with all parameters, and reserved parameters 
	  except the -batchlist and -errlist options.  It saves the command line 
	  parameters to a file in <def>PVL</def> format.  The parameters in the output 
	  file that is saved can be restored into the program using the -restore option.  
	  The default file name is <b><i>programName</i>.par</b>.  If the -save
          option is not used, the history file will be saved by default in the location 
	  specified in the preference file under HistoryPath.  If only -save is used, 
	  the file will be saved in the current directory.  If the -save option is 
	  used with a specific filename, it will be saved to that file.
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
highpass from=input.cub to=output.cub lines=5 samples=5 -save=hpf/saveFile.par
highpass from=input.cub to=output.cub lines=5 samples=5 -save
</pre>
        <p>
          In the first example, the program will save the parameter information in 
	  the <b>saveFile.par</b> file in the <b>hpf</b> directory.  The second example 
	  would save the same parameter information to <b>highpass.par</b> file 
	  in the current directory.
        </p>

        <h3>-verbose Parameter</h3>

        <p>
          This parameter can be used with all parameters including the reserved 
	  parameters.  If the terminal output preference is turned off in the 
	  default preferences file, the -verbose option will override it, and 
	  print the terminal output to the screen for the current command only.  
	  For example:
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:2em;">
highpass from=input.cub to=output.cub lines=5 samples=5 -verbose
</pre>
        <p>
          The terminal output would be written out to the screen as the program 
	  was executed.
        </p>

        <h2>Error Status</h2>

        <p>
          In the command line mode, programs exit with a status indicating 
	  success (zero) or failure (non-zero).  The status codes are useful to 
          determine a course of action when batch processing scripts are developed 
          to run a series of ISIS programs.  Further information regarding the status 
          can be found in the
         <a href="../ErrorHandlingFacility/ErrorHandlingFacility.html">ISIS Error Handling Facility</a>.
