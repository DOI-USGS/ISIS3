                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Isis Application Test files are used to ensure that an application is working correctly.  Isis Category Test files are
                    used to ensure that a category is working correctly.  These tests are especially important when porting to a new
                    operating system, or changing compilers.  They are also important when changes are made to the entire
                    system (such as refactoring) or to other files that directly affect the application.  If something is changed that affects
                    the outcome of the application, the test will fail, making the programmer aware that something has changed and
                    needs to be examined.  This guide focuses on the specific 
                    task of adding tests to an existing application or category.

                <!-- QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS -->
                <h2>Questions &amp; Answers</h2>

                <h3>What do I need to know?</h3>
                <p>
                    You need to be familiar with what the application or category does in order to test it properly.  Also a basic knowledge of make
                    would be helpful but not required.
                </p>

                <h3>What is make?</h3>
                <p>
                    Make is a programming tool used to automate the build process.  Make is used used to build C/C++ projects.
                </p>

                <!-- Make Basics-->
                <h2>Make Basics</h2>

                <h3>Targets</h3>
                <p>
                    Make is a text file that is broken down into what is known as targets.  Targets represent a series of actions as a
                    single word.  Targets are distinguished by the colon ( : ) after the target name
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            clean:
                            &#09;
                            <I>actions</I>
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                    An action is a single command that is terminated by a semicolon ( ; ).  If a command must be on multiple lines, each line
                    must end with a backslash ( \ ).
                    <pre>
                        <code>
                            clean:
                            &#09;ratio num=isisTruth.cub+1 \
                            &#09;den=isisTruth.cub+2 \
                            &#09;to=temp.cub;
                        </code>
                    </pre>

                    If there is any character, after the backslash (even a space),  the command will end
                    at that line.  Make will not show an error but the command will not run as intended.
                    <p>
                        Each line in a target must be preceded with a tab character.  Make will show an error if there is not a tab at the
                        front of each line in a target.
                    </p>
                </p>

                <h3>Variables</h3>
                <p>
                    Make allows for variables to be used to store values.  These variables can be set at the command line by using
                    the syntax VARIABLE=value.  For example, setting the variable clean would be CLEAN=yes.  Variables are usually in
                    all capital letters.  Variables are accessed using the $( ) syntax.  For example, using the clean variable would be
                    $(CLEAN).
                </p>

                <h2>Writing a Test for an application</h2>

                <h3>Test Structure</h3>
                <p>
                    A test is composed of input, output, truth and make files.  All of the files the test needs as input are placed in the
                    input directory.  Everything the test generates goes into the output directory.  When the test is working correctly the
                    output files representing the base truth files of the test are placed in the truth directory.  The make file contains the
                    commands to run the test.
                </p>

                <h3>Test Results</h3>
                <p>
                    Tests are to ensure that the programs are running correctly.  This is done by comparing the output files generated
                    by the test with the files designated as the truth for the test.  If the files have the same contents the test shows an
                    OK status.  If the files are different in some way the test shows a FAILED status.
                </p>

                <h3>Setup Tests</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to the directory where the application directory is located</li>
                    <li>Type
                        <I>make testdir</I>
                    </li>
                    <ol>
                        <li type="a">This creates a directory call tsts </li>
                        <li type="a">Places a Makefile for creating tests in the tsts directory </li>
                    </ol>
                </ol>

                <h3>Setup Individual Test</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Within the tsts directory type
                        <I>make newtest TEST=testname</I>
                    </li>
                    <ol>
                        <li type="a">Where testname is the name of the test.  Testname should decribe what the test is testing for.</li>
                        <li type="a">e.g. if the program has a variable mode that can be ALL or NONE, the test for mode all would be
                            named all and the test for mode none would be none.</li>
                        <li type="a">The command would be
                            <I>make newtest TEST=all</I>
                        </li>
                        <li type="a">This creates a directory called testname and places a template makefile, and an input directory in that directory</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>Type
                        <I>cd testname</I>
                        to chage directories to the test</li>
                </ol>

                The template makefile should look like this.
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        APPNAME =

                        include $(ISISROOT)/make/isismake.tsts

                        commands:
                        > /dev/null;
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <ol>
                    <li>APPNAME - name of the application being tested</li>
                    <li>include - includes all targets from the isismake.tsts file</li>
                    <li>commands - defines the commands target needed to run the test</li>
                    <li>/dev/null - all actions are placed before or on this line</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Write Test</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>APPNAME - type in the application name after the equals.  Capitalization and spelling count here. </li>
                    <ol>
                        <li type="a">The excetable for the test resides two directories above the test.  APPNAME is adjusted
                            during the run of the test to take care of this.  APPNAME should just be the name of the program.
                            Each time the test is run, the current version of the executable is used.  Running the test will not
                            remake the executable.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>Write in commands before the > /dev/null.</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li type="a">Remember</li>
                        <ol>
                            <li type="1">if multiple commands are needed than each needs > /dev/null;
                                at the end of the commands</li>
                            <li type="1">beginning of each line needs a tab character</li>
                            <li type="1">if a command goes onto multiple lines, end of each line needs a \ with
                                nothing after it </li>
                        </ol>
                    </ol>
                    <li>Type $(APPNAME) where the need of the current application is being used.  Other program names
                        should just be the name of the program.</li>
                    <li>Copy any input files to the input directory</li>
                    <li>Set all paths in the test so that the input files have $(INPUT) before the filename</li>
                    <li>Set all paths in the test so that the output files have $(OUTPUT) before the filename</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li type="a">Files that are to be compared for the test must be in the output directory</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>If the test is testing standardout, the output must be redirected to a text file.  Change the /dev/null to
                        the name of a text file for comparison.  See cathist for an example of this.</li>
                    <li>To generate the output files for the test type
                        <I>make output</I>

                    <li>Add variables as needed to the test.  Variables are defined in the next section</li>
                    <li>When the output file looks good type
                        <I>make truthdata</I>
                    </li>
                    <ol>
                        <li type="a">if the test is operating system dependent test than do

                        <I>make test</I>
                        .  At this point the test shoud pass.  If not, revise the test till it does.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Test Variables</h3>
                <p>
                    Tests deal with files.  Variables for the tests are strings attached to the end of file names.  For example
                    if the file is test.txt then the variable IGNORELINES would be test.txt.IGNORELINES.  The file portion must match spelling and
                    capitalization of the file it is assoiciated with.  The variable portion (.IGNORELINES) needs to be in all capital letters.
                    For each file in the test if the variable is not set than a default value is used.

                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Possible variables for file types are:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Cub files (.cub)</li>
                        <ol>
                            <li type="a">.TOLERANCE</li>
                            <ol>
                                <li type="I">Defines the difference in dn values allowed between the cubes generated by the test and the truth cubes,
                                    to allow the test to pass </li>
                                <li type="I">Value - number, usually a small decimal value</li>
                                <li type="I">Defaults - 0, meaning that the two dn values have to match exactly</li>
                                <li type="I">For an example, see the mpp test in the cam2map application</li>
                            </ol>

                                <li type="I">Value - yes or no value</li>
                                <li type="I">Defaults - no, special pixels will be used in the comparison of two cube files</li>

               <h3>Pvl Files</h3>
               <p>
                 In order to assure the most accurate testing possible, pvl (parameter value language)  files are compared by parsing through the groups, objects and keywords in the file.
                 Any file with a .pvl extension is considered a pvl file. Because pvl files contain text, the text file test variables will work on the pvl files; it is not recommended to use
                 these test variables, however, and the result must still be a valid pvl file. The order of the keywords, objects and groups matter and may not be different in any case.
                 In order to set tolerances and ignore keywords, a pvl tolerance file with .DIFF attached to the end will be used. For example, if if file is test.pvl then the tolerance file must be named
                 test.pvl.DIFF. These files must only exist in the input data 
                 directory. Inside the pvl tolerance file you can specify 
                 numerical tolerances and keywords to ignore. Inside the pvl 
                 tolerance file, there should be one or two groups, Tolerances 
                 and IgnoreKeys, in the root of the file. So, a basic pvl 
                 tolerance file looks like this:
                 <pre>
                   <code>
Group = Tolerances
End_Group

Group = IgnoreKeys
End_Group

End
                   </code>
                 </pre>
                 To set a tolerance on a number, inside the Tolerances group there must be a keyword in this format:
                 <pre>
                   <code>
KeywordName = MaximumDifference
                   </code>
                 </pre>
                 If the output and truth data values exceed the maximum difference (tolerance), then the files are not considered the same. In order to ignore a non-numerical value, such as a
                 file name, inside the IgnoreKeys group there must be a keyword in this format:
                 <pre>
                   <code>
KeywordName = true
                   </code>
                 </pre>
                 Note: The value of this keyword does not matter. <br />
                 With these formats in mind, to give a tolerance for the keyword 
                 StandardDeviation of 0.0000000001 and ignore the keyword 
                 FileName the pvl tolerance file would look like this:
                 <pre>
                   <code>
Group = Tolerances
  StandardDeviation = 0.0000000001
End_Group

Group = IgnoreKeys
  FileName = true
End_Group

End
                   </code>
                 </pre>
                 To debug these files, or see why two pvl files compare as different, you can use pvldiff. The FROM parameter will be the output file
                 (which will be created with the command <I>make output</I>), the FROM2 parameter will be the truth file and the DIFF parameter will be
                 the DIFF file inside of the input folder (the same as the FROM2 parameter with .DIFF added on to the end). When pvldiff is run, it will output
                 the first difference it finds that exceeds the tolerances.  <br />
                 For an example of the pvl test, say we have the pvl file cubelabels.pvl that looks like this:
                 <pre>
                   <code>
Object = IsisCube
  Object = Core
    StartByte   = 65537
    Format      = Tile
    TileSamples = 128
    TileLines   = 128

    Group = Dimensions
      Samples = 1024
      Lines   = 1024
      Bands   = 7
    End_Group

    Group = Pixels
      Type       = Real
      ByteOrder  = LSB
      Base       = 0.0
      Multiplier = 1.0
    End_Group
  End_Object
End_Object

Object = SomeObject
  SomeCalculaion = 5536.4363463414
End_Object

End
                   </code>
                 </pre>
                 The SomeCalculation keyword may vary by 0.000000001 and the ByteOrder could be MSB or LSB. To compensate for this, you would add a file named cubelabels.pvl.DIFF in
                 the input folder with the following:
                 <pre>
                   <code>
Group = Tolerances
  SomeCalculation = 0.000000001
End_Group

Group = IgnoreKeys
  ByteOrder = true
End_Group

End
                   </code>
                 </pre>
                 This would ignore the value of ByteOrder always and SomeCalculation if it were within the tolerance.
                <p>
                    Finally, you can create unique tolerances and ignore 
                    keys for each element of an array contained within a 
                    keyword, like so:
                </p>
                <pre>
                  <code>
Group = Tolerances
 SomeArray = (0.000000001, 0.0, 0.025)
 AnotherArray = 0.000000001
End_Group

Group = IgnoreKeys
 SomeArray =(false, true, false)
End_Group

End
                  </code>
                </pre>
                In the above case, the keyword SomeArray would have a tolerance 
                of 0.000000001 applied to the first element, a tolerance of 
                0.025 applied to the third element, and the second element would 
                be ignored entirely.  
                <p>
                    Just make sure when working with arrays that you have
                    exactly the same number of tolerances/ignore keys for the 
                    keyword as there are elements in the array.  Alternatively, 
                    you can list only one tolerance or ignore key for the 
                    keyword, and it will be applied to every element in the 
                    array.  In the above case, the keyword AnotherArray could
                    have 50 elements, but each element would have a tolerance of
                    0.000000001 applied to it.  Having multiple tolerances and 
                    ignore keys without matching the number of array elements, 
                    however, will result in an error.  
                </p>
               </p>

                <h3>Test Data</h3>
                <p>
                    In order to perserve the data that is used by the test,  type
                    <I>make checkin</I>
                    .  This copies the contents of the input and truth directories to the testdata area.  Since the output files can be generated
                    by using the output command, these files do not need to be saved. Once the files are stored in the
                    testdata area you can do
                    <I>make release</I>
                    to remove all of the files exept the makefile.  Then the makefile can be checked into cvs.  To restore these files back into the test,  type
                    <I>make checkout</I>
                    . This copies the files into the proper directories.  Once the files for the test are in the test data area, the test
                    will still run even if the test files are not in the same directory as the test.
                </p>

                <h3>Writing a Test for a category</h3>
                <p>
                    Category tests work the same way as application tests do.  The difference is that category tests don't test a
                    single program but a sequence of programs.  Therefore the APPNAME isn't needed for a category test and
                    can be deleted safely. All of the variables for testing an application also work for the category test.
                </p>

                            </pre>
