        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <h3>Operating System Requirements</h3>
        <p>ISIS runs on many Unix variants including:</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Ubuntu</li>
         <li>RHEL</li>
         <li>Debian</li>
         <li>Fedora</li>
         <li>SUSE</li>
         <li>MacOSX</li>
        </ul>
         <p>It does not run on MS Windows.</p>

         <h3>Hardware Requirements</h3>
         <p>ISIS has fairly minimal requirements depending on your needs:</p>
         <ul>
         <li>64-bit x86 processors (more cores is better)</li>
         <lI>2GB memory (more memory is better)</lI>
         <li>10GB to 180GB disk storage for ISIS installation</li>
         <li>10GB to many TB disk storage for processing images</li>
         <li>Quality graphics card (one that support two monitors can be useful)</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Mission Requirements</h3>
         <p>ISIS supports many planetary missions; in fact, over 40 different instruments including some
         flown as early
         as the 1960's.  Ancillary data is required to process images from these instruments.  For example, translation
         definition files to help convert from PDS format to ISIS cubes, dark current and flat file images are used for radiometric
         calibration, and large quantities of SPICE files (spacecraft pointing and position) for map projecting images.
         If you plan to work with data
         from all missions then the download will require about 180GB for all the ancillary data.  However, most of this
         volume is taken up by SPICE files.  We have a SPICE Web service that can be used in lieu of downloading all of the
         SPICE files which can reduce the download size to 10GB.  When downloading ISIS you will have the option of
         choosing which mission data to acquire as well as if you only want the translation and calibration files and not
         SPICE files.
         </p>

         <h3>DTM Requirements</h3>
         <p>A strength of ISIS lies in it capabilities for planetary cartography.
         The image orthorectification process is improved if a digital
         terrain model is used (DTM).  The DTMs can be quite large and take time to download.  They can also exist for
         many planetary bodies (e.g., Moon, Mars, etc). Therefore there are options for selecting which DTMs to download
         if you are only working with a particular target body.
         </p>

         <h2>Installation</h2>

        <h3>Recommended Installation Process</h3>
        <p>
          Isis 3 now features a downloadable Java-based installer.  The installer provides user options for chosing which mission packages and target DEMS (e.g. Mars, Moon) to download.
          It also includes the sizes of the packages.   During the installation process, you can chose to use the ISIS SPICE web service which will eliminate the need to download most of the
          SPICE data for a mission.
        </p>
        <p>
          To run the installer, download the isisInstall.sh Bashscript from the link below and execute it.  This script will automatically fetch the most recent version of the installer and
          launch it.  Depending on
          your browser, you may need to right-click and select "Save Link As..."
          to download:
        <pre>
          <a href="assets/isisInstall.sh" target="_blank">Installation Script</a>
        </pre>
          After downloading the script, open a terminal in the directory where
          the script was installed.  Give the installation script executable
          permissions and run it by typing the following:
          <pre>
            chmod +x isisInstall.sh
            ./isisInstall.sh
          </pre>
          For additional options and help, give the script the <i>-h</i> option:
          <pre>
            ./isisInstall.sh -h
          </pre>
          This script has been written with the goal of never needing to be
          updated.  However, after downloading and setting $ISISROOT, the latest
          version of the installation script can be obtained at the following
          location on your local machine:
          <pre>
            $ISISROOT/src/docsys/documents/InstallGuide/assets/isisInstall.sh
          </pre>
        </p>

        <h3>Alternate Installation Process</h3>
        <p>
          If you are familar with the Unix rsync command and prefer to use the old installation information
          follow this link:
          <a href="#rsyncInstallation">Rsync Installation</a>
        </p>



       <h2>FAQs</h2>
       <h3>Can't connect to the rsync server</h3>
       <p>
         This is one of the biggest issues with downloading ISIS.  Most problems stem from a firewall restriction on
         the user's side.   USGS has opened the rsync port to allow access to our server.  Your institution likely has
         a firewall and may not allow the access to our rsync server.  Start by making sure you can connect to our
         rsync server.  Type the following command:
          <pre>
            rsync isisdist.wr.usgs.gov::

            or

            rsync isisdist.astrogeology.usgs.gov::
          </pre>
          This should list the packages available for download.  If you do not receive this list then 1) either both of our servers
          are down or 2) your firewall does not allow access.  In the former case please post a message on our
          <a href="http://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/IsisSupport">support board</a>.  In the later case, see you local
          system administrator.  </p>

          <p>
          You can also try an alternative port number that we have setup (port 80).  This is the
          standard http port which is open through most firewalls.  However, some institutes have appliances that examine
          this traffic and if it doesn't appear to look like web content disconnects or is so slow the download would take forever.
       </p>
       <p>
          Example use of port 80:
         <pre>rsync -azv --delete --partial --port=80 isisdist.astrogeology.usgs.gov::x86-64_linux_RHEL6/isis .</pre>
       </p>

       <p>
       If you are still running into problems you can try a different network path.  For example, your home network to see if
       you can make connections to our rsync server.
    </p>


    <h3>How do I know if the rsync commands were successful</h3>
    <p>
      Unfortunately rsync sometimes hangs or doesn't complete because of dropped network connections.  The drops can happen
      on your end, our end, or anywhere in between.  Keep rerunning rsync until the command completes.
    </p>

    <h3>How do I get updates to ISIS</h3>
    <p>
    Just rerun the the rsync commands or GUI installer (which uses rsync) again.  Rsync only acquires files that have changed or don't
    exist in you installation.  The update process will typically be much faster than the original download.
    </p>

    <h3>How often do you update ISIS</h3>
    <p>
      We update our mission data areas often (sometime nightly) as new SPICE files are provided by the active missions.  Our binaries (application programs) are updated
      on a quarterly schedule.
    </p>


    <h3>How do I install ISIS2</h3>
    <p>
         If you are looking for Isis 2, please
        <a href="http://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/Isis2/isis-bin/installation.cgi">refer to the Isis 2 Installation
        Guide</a> for instructions on downloading and installing Isis 2.
    </p>

        <p>
        Isis 3 and Isis 2 will have collisions of executable names (e.g.,
        pds2isis exists in both systems).  It is best to remove initializations
        of Isis 2 from your local startup file (e.g., .cshrc) otherwise you may get unpredictable
        results.
        </p>


        <h3>When will a Windows version be available</h3>
            <p>
                Currently we have limited software development staff to support and modify ISIS, which implies directly running on a native Windows
                environment is not something that will happen in the near future.
             </p>



             <h3>What operating systems have been dropped</h3>
             <p>
               As operating systems and hardware age security flaws are no longer patched and new APIs are not upgraded, which stunts the growth of ISIS on those systems.
               Therefore we no longer build ISIS on the following platforms:
               <pre>
                 Linux SuSE 9.X, 10.X
                 RedHat Enterprise 3, 4, 5
                 Mac OSX with the Power PC processor
                 Mac OSX 10.4, 10.5
               </pre>
             </p>



             <h3>I just can't get ISIS installed.  What can I do</h3>
             <p>
               If you encounter any problems we will be monitoring our discussion
               board daily and will respond to any questions as best we can.  Other people
               have posted problems and may have similar issues to you.

        <h2>Manual Installation</h2>
        <h3>Creating a Download Directory</h3>


        <p>
            We suggest you install Isis3 in a work area. Change your current working directory to
            where you want isis3 installed and create a directory named isis3.
            The rsync commands in the next step will place all of Isis and the SPICE
            kernels under this directory.

            Example:
       <pre>
        $ cd /work1
        $ mkdir isis3
        $ cd isis3
       </pre>

        </p>

        <p>
          <span style="font-size:120%; color:red; font-weight:bold">Warning:<i>
           You must be in the correct directory as shown above, and you
           must type the below rsync commands correctly. If you do not you could
           remove files not associated with ISIS.  That is ... you could remove
           personal files on your computer.   Please research and understand
           the rsync command, especially the --delete option.
            </i></span>
        </p>


        <h3>Choosing a Rsync Server</h3>

        <p>
          We are distributing Isis3 using two rsync servers. If the "rsync"
          command is is not available on your system please see your system
          administrator. To download Isis3 follow the example for your hardware
          and operating system combination.
          <strong><i>Make sure to include the period "." at the end of the "rsync"
          commands - if you don't, you will only get a list of available
          downloads from the rsync server.</i></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We have two rsync servers and suggest using the first server as it is a much faster
          connection.
         </p>
        <ul>
          <li>100Mbit/sec - isisdist.astrogeology.usgs.gov</li>
          <li>10Mbit/sec - isisdist.wr.usgs.gov</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          All of the example commands below use the faster server name. You
          can use the slower server name if you need to through simple substitution.
        </p>



        <h3>Downloading the ISIS Binaries (Required)</h3>
        <p>
        Choose the rsync command for your operating system.  Don't forget to type the "space period"
        at the end of the rsync command line or you will only get a listing of the files.
        </p>

<h3>Full Data Download</h3>

<p>
    If you have the disk space and network speed you may want to download all of the ISIS data areas which
    includes all missions supported by ISIS.   This takes over 130GB of disk space!!  If you only have a 10Mbps
    network connection it will take nearly two days to download.  If you want to acquire only certain mission data
     <a href="#MissionSpecific">click here</a>.   To download all Isis3 data files continue reading.
</p>
<p>
    Remember to use this followng command from the same directory you ran the previous rsync
    command. In the example it was "/work1/isis3".
</p>
      <pre>
      rsync -azv --delete --partial isisdist.astrogeology.usgs.gov::isis3data/data .
      </pre>
<p>
 Note:  The above command downloads all ISIS data including the required base data area and all of the optional mission
 data areas.  After completing this step skip to the <a href="#UnixEnvironment">Unix Environment Setup</a>.  If you chose
 not to download everything at once then continue below.
</p>


 <A NAME="MissionSpecific"> </A>

        <h3>Partial Download of ISIS3 Base Data (Required)</h3>
        <p>
            The base data area is separate from the source code. This data area is
            crucial to Isis3 and must be downloaded.
        </p>
<pre>
        rsync -azv --delete --partial isisdist.astrogeology.usgs.gov::isis3data/data/base data/
</pre>

<h3>Partial Download of Mission Specific Data</h3>


        <p>
          There are many missions supported by ISIS.  If you are only working with a few missions
          then you should download only those specific data areas.    One way you can save time and space is to not download the SPICE data
          for the mission you need.  If chose to do so read the next section about the SPICE Web Service that
          provides instructions for excluding the SPICE kernels.  Otherwise <a href="#ApolloMission">jump</a> to the mission
          specific sections.
         </p>


<h3>ISIS SPICE Web Service</h3>

<p>
  Isis can now use a service to retrieve the SPICE data for all instruments ISIS supports
  via the internet. To use this service instead of your local SPICE data, click the WEB check box in
  the spiceinit program GUI or type spiceinit web=yes at the command line. Using the ISIS SPICE Web
  Service will significantly reduce the size of the downloads from our data area.
  
  If you want to use this new service, without having to download all the SPICE data, add the
  following argument to the mission-specific rsync command:
 </p>
<pre>
            --exclude='kernels'
</pre>
        <p>
          For example: rsync -azv <strong>--exclude='kernels'</strong> --delete --partial isisdist.astrogeology.usgs.gov::isis3data/data/cassini data/
        </p>

        <span style="font-size:120%; color:red; font-weight:bold">
          WARNING: Some missions do not currently support calibration when using the SPICE Web

        <h2>Example Isis 3 Download</h2>
        <p>
          This is an example of downloading Isis onto a RedHat 6 system using
          tcsh as your shell.
        </p>
        <pre>
          $ cd /work
          $ mkdir isis3
          $ cd isis3
          $ rsync -azv --delete --partial isisdist.astrogeology.usgs.gov::x86-64_linux_RHEL6/isis .

          **now pick your missions without kernels**
          **example MRO**
          $ rsync -azv --delete --partial --exclude='kernels' isisdist.astrogeology.usgs.gov::isis3data/data/mro data/
          **example LRO**
          $ rsync -azv --delete --partial --exclude='kernels' isisdist.astrogeology.usgs.gov::isis3data/data/lro data/
          for csh users edit your .cshrc and add
          setenv ISISROOT /work/isis3/isis
          source $ISISROOT/scripts/isis3Startup.csh
        </pre>

        <h2>UNIX Environment Setup</h2>
        <p>
            Isis3 needs to know where all its pieces are located. We use an
            environment variable called "ISISROOT" to do this. Unix commands must
            be put into your startup shell scripts.  Assuming you installed ISIS in
            the directory /work1/isis3 add the following commands to your startup
            script:
        </p>

        <p>
            for C shells:
        </p>
<pre>
        setenv ISISROOT /work1/isis3/isis
</pre>

        <p>
            for Bourne shells:
        </p>
<pre>
        ISISROOT=/work1/isis3/isis
        export ISISROOT
</pre>

        <p>
            Run the startup script for Isis. This script assumes you installed
            the Isis 3 data area in the same directory you installed the Isis 3
            package. If you did not do this, you will need to modify the script to
            meet your needs.
        </p>

        <p>
            for C shells:
        </p>
<pre>
        source $ISISROOT/scripts/isis3Startup.csh
</pre>

        <p>
            for Bourne shells:
        </p>
<pre>
        . $ISISROOT/scripts/isis3Startup.sh
</pre>
