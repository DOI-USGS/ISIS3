        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
          Define an ISIS compatibility policy between
          releases of ISIS that minimizes impact on the user
          base while allowing the future growth and the maintainability
          of ISIS.
        </p>

        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>
          The scope of document is to describe how the ISIS development team will
          promote backward compatibility for individuals and groups developing
          scripts
          and pipelines that use the ISIS application programs to process images.
          It
          is not intended to cover backward compatibility of the API; that is, for
          those
          few people outside of the USGS developing new ISIS programs.
        </p>

        <h2>User Expectations</h2>
        <p>
          “Backward compatibility for any software
            platform is a high priority. Clean, maintainable code is also a high
            priority for any software platform. Sadly, in practice, these two
            ideals are often at odds.  Providing backward compatibility support
            makes software more complex and less maintainable.” [1]
          </p>
        <p>
           Both the ISIS developers and users are responsible for facilitating a
           quality
           backward compatibility plan that meets the objective.  As such, users are
           expected to:

          <ul>
            <li>Recognize 100% compatibility is not achievable</li>
            <li> Read the release notes</li>
            <li> Read our backward compatibility notes</li>
            <li>Be cognizant of deprecated programs and parameters</li>
            <li> Use full parameter names and values for ISIS programs in
            scripts
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>
          Software Developer Expectations
        </h2>
        <p>
          The USGS ISIS developers can make the largest difference in promoting
          backward compatibility.  They are expected to:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Adhere to development standards
            </li>
            <li>
              Follow the clearly defined development process
            </li>
            <li>
              Write well designed user interfaces
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>
          Techniques for Achieving Backward Compatibility
        </h2>
        <p>
          This section list techniques that ISIS developers will use for providing
          backward compatibility.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Follow the Checklist
        </h3>
        <p>
          Any change to ISIS requires the developer follows a checklist.  A box on
          the checklist addresses backward compatibility.  If you don’t check this
          box you must note a backward compatibility issue in the release notes (XML
          history or C++ header).
        </p>

        <h3>
          Follow the Parameter Naming Standards
        </h3>
        <p>
          A checkbox exists for following parameter naming standards as found on the
          internal ISIS Wiki development page.   Verify that parameters names are
          consistent so that they don’t need to be changed in the future.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Major Program Changes
        </h3>
        <p>
          If major program changes are made to a significant ISIS application
          (e.g., cam2map) it is probably best to create a new program name.  For
          example, if we are going to rework the entire photometric
          normalization package we should leave the “photomet” program alone
          and write an new program called “photometry”.   The photomet
          program must be deprecated in the future to prevent code bloat and
          maintenance issues.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Create Command Lines Alias (expect in March 2013 release)
        </h3>
        <p>
          In the future we will modify the ISIS API to allow for aliases of command
          line
          parameter names.  This allows us to standardize parameter names
          without breaking scripts and pipelines.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Program and Parameter Deprecation
        </h3>
        <p>
          Document when programs and/or parameters will be deprecated,
          typically a one year notice.  This will give users the chance to fix
          their scripts and pipelines
        </p>

        <h3>
          Consider the Cost Impact to both Users and Programmers
        </h3>
        <p>
          This is obviously difficult, as a programmer wants to develop clean easily
          maintainable code.
          Sometimes that means changing the user interface which impacts user.
          Think about how many users you will be impacting.   Is it a commonly
          used program versus one that isn’t?  Likewise, think about the
          long-term software maintenance that goes into supporting
          compatibility.  Are we doubling the code base for an application?
          Unfortunately there is no great answer here other than you are going
          to either frustrate users by breaking their scripts or frustrate
          developers by having them maintain much more code or frustrate
          Astrogeology project chiefs by taking longer and increasing costs to
          develop the code while adhering to backward compatibility.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Address Most Common Problems
        </h3>
        <p>
          Users have identified changing parameter names and defaults are some of the
          most common
          backward compatibility problems.   When possible, do not make these
          changes.  A second area is changing the contents of output of PVL or
          text files.  For example, programs like “stats” which produced
          textual output that can be used in scripts.
        </p>

        <h2>
          When Compatibility is Broken
        </h2>
        <p>
          Unfortunately there will be times when compatibility is broken.  The best
          answer is to provide quality
          documentation so that the user is aware of these changes.  Hence, the
          User Expectations to read the release notes and compatibility notes.
        </p>

        <p>
          The ISIS release notes for an application or API change should contain
        the tag “Backward Compatibility Issue” when we believe we have
        impacted how a program operates in scripts.  Be aware there may be
        multiple instances of the tag in the release notes.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition, in the release notes there is ISIS documentation with a table
          listing:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Program names that have been removed
          </li>
          <li>
            Parameters that have been deleted
          </li>
          <li>
            New parameters that have been added without defaults
          </li>
          <li>
            Parameters that have had the default value changed
          </li>
        </ul>
