        Software and related material (data and (or) documentation),
        contained in or furnished in connection with a software
        distribution, are made available by the U.S. Geological
        Survey (USGS) to be used in the public interest and in the
        advancement of science. You may, without any fee or cost, use,
        copy, modify, or distribute this software, and any derivative
        works thereof, and its supporting documentation, subject
        to the following restrictions and understandings.
        </p>

        <p>
        If you distribute copies or modifications of the
        software and related material, make sure the recipients
        receive a copy of this notice and receive or can get a copy
        of the original distribution. If the software and (or) related
        material are modified and distributed, it must be made clear
        that the recipients do not have the original and they must be
        informed of the extent of the modifications. For example,
        modified files must include a prominent notice stating
        the modifications made, the author of the modifications,
        and the date the modifications were made. This restriction
        is necessary to guard against problems introduced in the
        software by others, reflecting negatively on the reputation
        of the USGS.
        </p>

        <p>
        The software is public property and you therefore have the
        right to the source code, if desired.  You may charge fees
        for distribution, warranties, and services provided in

        name USGS can be used in any advertising or publicity to
        endorse or promote any products or commercial entity
        using this software if specific written permission is
        obtained from the USGS.
