        <!-- OVERVIEW -->
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
           Isis Application XML files are used for a variety of purposes: a guide for users, documentation for programmers, context-sensitive help,
           and generating the application window when a user runs the program in graphical mode to name a few. This guide focuses on the
           specific task of adding examples to an application's XML file, which become part of the users' Software Manual.
        </p>

        <p>
          All sample code below is from the <tt><a href="../../Application/presentation/Tabbed/crop/crop.html">crop</a></tt> application unless
          noted otherwise.
        </p>


        <!-- QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS -->
        <h2>Questions &amp; Answers</h2>

        <h3>What do I need to know?</h3>
        <p>
            You should have a general understanding of what XML is - this document explains how to add to an XML file in order
            to add an example to the software documentation. You may want to be able to write basic HTML in order to enhance the formatting
            of certain sections. You should know some basic image processing, such as how to create a JPEG, how to resize an image and sharpen
            it, and so forth -- the image processing tasks required can be performed in Isis, Adobe Photoshop, or a number of other popular image
            processing software packages.
            It also helps if you are familiar with the Isis web site and how it is organized from a visitor's standpoint. There are many good tutorials on the web
            for learning XML and HTML, such as <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/default.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools.com</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>What is an Application?</h3>
        <p>
          In a nutshell: it's a computer program, or software. For example, in Isis <tt>algebra</tt>, <tt>sharpen</tt>, and <tt>compare</tt> are all applications.
        </p>

        <h3>What is Application XML?</h3>
        <p>
          Each application has a file describing it - what parameters it takes, what values are valid for those parameters, who wrote the software,
          descriptions of what the software does, etc. The file is used to generate web page documentation and provide information to the application when
          it runs. The file is written in the Application XML language, which specifies how the information about an application is stored in the file.
        </p>

        <h3>Where do I find the Application XML specification?</h3>
        <p>
            A
            <a href="../../Schemas/Application/documentation/index.html">
            handy reference to the Application XML language</a> is available as part of the Isis documentation.
        </p>

        <h3>What does "mandatory by policy" mean?</h3>
        <p>
            An element that is "mandatory by policy" means it must be used in certain situations according to the policies
            of the Isis Programming Team, USGS, DOI, Section 508, or common sense. For instance, specifying file size
            for non-text files is a USGS policy and is standard practice in web development - when a link to a non-text file
            is created on the Isis website, the link will include the file size information so visitors will know how big the file
            they're getting ready to download is. Not only does the USGS say we have to give this information, but it's also a
            very polite practice, and visitors love polite web developers.
        </p>

        <h3>Where do the Application XML files go in the Isis structure?</h3>
        <p>
            Base Application XML files and source code all live in $ISISROOT/src/base/apps/. Mission-specific Application XML files
            and source code live in $ISISROOT/src/{mission}/apps/. Each application has its own directory with the same name as the
            application where the application's XML and source code are kept. Documentation subcomponents (such as example images) reside in a
            directory named <tt>assets</tt> under the application directory.
            An Application XML file is named the same as the application name with a .xml extension. For example, <tt>ratio</tt>:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>resides in $ISISROOT/src/base/ratio/</li>
          <li>its XML file is $ISISROOT/src/base/ratio/ratio.xml</li>
          <li>all the images in its examples are under the $ISISROOT/src/base/apps/ratio/assets/ directory</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>What happens to the examples I write?</h3>

              <a href="assets/screenshot.jpg" target="_blank">
              <img class="blackBorderedImage" src="assets/screenshot_small.jpg" width="106" height="200" alt="[Screenshot - Crop Application Web Page]" align="left"/></a>

              <p>
                  When the Isis system is built, the <a href="../../Application/index.html">Isis Software Manual</a> is generated from the Application XML files.
                  Each application has its own web page in the manual, and the examples are part of the page for their respective applications.
              </p>
              <p>
                  The image to the left
                  illustrates how the example for the <tt><a href="../../Application/presentation/Tabbed/crop/crop.html">crop</a></tt>
                  application was transformed into a web page. Click the image to open a larger version of the screen shot in a new window (445x800, 115 KB).
              </p>

              <br clear="all"/>
              <br/>

        <h3>How do I preview the examples as a web page?</h3>

              <p>
                Each application has a <tt>make</tt> target to automatically generate a web page from the application's XML file. Run
                the following command, filling in the application name for <i>application</i>: <tt>make <i>application</i>.html</tt> and
                open the <i>application</i>.html in your favorite web browser using the <b>File - Open</b> menu. For example, to
                preview the web page for <tt>crop</tt>, run <tt>make crop.html</tt> and open crop.html in your browser.
              </p>

        <h3>What is XML-Compliant HTML?</h3>
              <p>
                It's HTML code that is written to follow XML's rules.
                For example, all tags have a beginning and ending tag, empty tags (such as <tt>img</tt> and <tt>br</tt>)
                must have a slash before the ending angle bracket, all attributes must be in quotes, etc. See
                <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#diffs">W3C XHTML 1.0, Section 4: Differences with HTML 4</a> for more about writing XML-Compliant HTML.
              </p>

              <p>
                Remember, if you use HTML, you'll be formatting only a small part of the document, the headers, page title, body tags, and so forth are all ready handled for you.
                Avoid using structural elements, such as headings, horizontal rules, etc. Keep it simple - bold, italics, lists, <tt>code</tt>, <tt>pre</tt>, <tt>tt</tt>, and tables
                should be all most folks need. You may use <tt>span</tt> with the <tt>style</tt> attribute defined in place of text formatting (such as bold and italics) if you
                are comfortable with using CSS style language.
              </p>

        <!-- Anatomy -->
        <h3>Anatomy of Application XML</h3>
        <p>
              Each document must start with the XML document prolog:
              <pre><code>  &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;</code></pre>

              followed by the start root element:
              <pre><code>  &lt;application xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="http://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/Schemas/Application/application.xsd"&gt;</code></pre>

              The rest of the document is made up of the content, and ended with the closing tag of the root element:
              <pre><code>  &lt;/application&gt;</code></pre>
        </p>

        <p>
              The following chart illustrates the basic layout of the Application XML language used to write the application file.
              The <tt>examples</tt> section is highlighted in the chart. Other sections of the Application XML file are discussed in separate documents.
        </p>

        <div style="text-align:center;">
                <img class="blackBorderedImage" src="assets/application_collapsed.png" width="384" height="575" alt="[Application XML Diagram]"/>
        </div>

        <br clear="all"/>

        <p>
          Each application XML file has one <tt>examples</tt> section, which may contain any number of <tt>example</tt> sections - one per example.
          The maximum recommended number of examples is three. Your examples should present a wide range of capabilities of the application.
        </p>

        <h3>Image</h3>

        <p>
             The <tt>image</tt> element is described here first because it is a special element used throughout the examples section of the
             Application XML language. The <tt>image</tt> element is used to describe an image you wish to use to illustrate your example.
             It is part of the <tt>guiInterface</tt>, <tt>inputImages</tt>, and <tt>outputImages</tt> elements described later in this document.
        </p>

        <div style="text-align:center;">
          <img class="blackBorderedImage" src="assets/image.png" width="373" height="366" alt="[Image Element - Application Examples XML Diagram]"/>
        </div>

        <p>
             <tt>image</tt> contains the following elements and attributes.
        </p>

        <h4>Attributes</h4>
        <p>
        All attributes are mandatory.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>width:</b> the width in pixels of the image (integer)</li>
          <li><b>height:</b> the height in pixels of the image (integer)</li>
          <li><b>src:</b> the path and file name of the image (path/filename)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Elements</h4>
        <p>
        All attributes are mandatory except for <tt>parameterName</tt>.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>brief:</b> a short (one sentence) description of the image</li>
          <li><b>description:</b> a long description or explanation, which may contain HTML</li>
          <li><b>parameterName:</b> the application parameter name associated with the image. <tt>parameterName</tt> is
                                                     mandatory by policy when image is used in <tt>inputImages</tt> or <tt>outputImages</tt>.
                                                     Do not use <tt>parameterName</tt> in <tt>guiInterfaces</tt>.
                                                     For example, if this image is the result of running the <tt>crop</tt> application, the parameter name is <tt>TO</tt>.
                                                     </li>
          <li><b>thumbnail:</b> A description of the thumbnail image associated with this image. <tt>thumbnail</tt> has the following attributes:
            <ul>
              <li><b>width:</b> the width in pixels of the thumbnail (integer)</li>
              <li><b>height:</b> the height in pixels of the thumbnail (integer)</li>
              <li><b>src:</b> the path and file name of the thumbnail (path/filename)</li>
              <li><b>caption:</b> a short caption describing the thumbnail (text)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Images: Tips and Hints</h4>

        <h5>Where should I put my images?</h5>
        <p>
          In the directory where your XML file resides, create an <tt>assets</tt> directory. In the <tt>assets</tt> directory, create
          an <tt>images</tt> and a <tt>thumbs</tt> directory. Store your images in the <tt>assets/images</tt> directory, and your
          thumbnails in the <tt>assets/thumbs</tt> directory.
        </p>

        <h5>What sizes should my images be?</h5>

        <p>
          Images should fit comfortably on a monitor set to 800x600 resolution. Thumbnails are used as clickable icons
          that represent the larger image. Thumbnails should be small enough
          to load on a web page quickly and take up minimal space on a web page, yet be large enough to give your
          audience a sense of what they will see if they choose to view the full sized image.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Images:</b> no larger than 750 pixels wide and 550 pixels tall</li>
          <li><b>Thumbnails:</b> no larger than 200 pixels wide or high, and no more than 32 KB file size</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>What format should my images be?</h5>
        <p>
          JPEG, PNG, or GIF. JPEG may be the easiest because Isis has a file exporter (<tt>isis2std</tt>).
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>JPEG:</b> 16 million colors, compress to reduce file size. Acceptable for all images.
            <ul>
              <li><b>Isis:</b> Quality 80 for regular images, Quality 50 for thumbnails and screen shots.</li>
              <li><b>Photoshop:</b> Quality 10 for regular images, Quality 8 for thumbnails and screen shots.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>PNG:</b> 256 to 16 million colors. Acceptable for all images.</li>
          <li><b>GIF:</b> 256 colors. Acceptable for screen shots and greyscale images.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>How do I create a screen shot of an application?</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Windows:</b> Click on the application window and hit <tt>Alt</tt> and <tt>PrtScn</tt> keys on the keyboard to copy the
                                           screen shot to your past buffer. Go to your favorite image processing software, create a new image and paste
                                           the screen shot into it.</li>
          <li><b>Linux:</b> Start the application and <tt>gimp</tt>.
          In <tt>gimp</tt>, open the <b>File - Acquire - Screen Shot</b> menu, set the delay to a few seconds, click on the
          application window to bring it to the front. When the mouse cursor turns to a plus sign (+),  click the application window again.
          <tt>gimp</tt> will display the screen shot. Right-click on the screen shot and go the the <b>File - Save</b> menu to save the image.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Sample Code</h4>
        <pre><code>  &lt;image src="assets/images/peaks.1.jpg" width="500" height="500"&gt;
    &lt;brief&gt;Input image for crop&lt;/brief&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;
      This is the input image for the 200x300 example of crop.
      The area to be "cropped" is shown in red.
    &lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;thumbnail caption=" Input image" src="assets/thumbs/peaks.1.jpg" width="200" height="200"/&gt;
    &lt;parameterName&gt;FROM&lt;/parameterName&gt;
  &lt;/image&gt;</code></pre>



        <!-- Brief -->
        <hr/>
        <h3>Brief</h3>

        <div style="text-align:center;">
          <img class="blackBorderedImage" src="assets/brief.png" width="122" height="58" alt="[Brief Element - Application Examples XML Diagram]"/>
        </div>

        <p>
          The <tt>brief</tt> element should contain a very brief (one sentence) synopsis or description of the example. This element may contain only text.
        </p>

        <h4>Sample Code</h4>
        <pre><code>  &lt;brief&gt;
    200x300 sub-area
  &lt;/brief&gt;</code></pre>

        <!-- Description -->
        <hr/>
        <h3>Description</h3>

        <div style="text-align:center;">
          <img class="blackBorderedImage" src="assets/description.png" width="284" height="63" alt="[Description Element - Application Examples XML Diagram]"/>
        </div>

        <p>
          The <tt>description</tt> element should contain a long description of the example, including any tips or instructions the user should be aware of. This element
          may contain XML-compliant HTML formatting.
        </p>

        <h4>Sample Code</h4>
        <pre><code>  &lt;description&gt;
    Extracting a 200x300 sub-area
  &lt;/description&gt;</code></pre>

        <!-- Terminal Interface -->
        <hr/>
        <h3>Terminal Interface</h3>

        <div style="text-align:center;">
          <img class="blackBorderedImage" src="assets/terminalInterface.png" width="504" height="134" alt="[Terminal Interface Element - Application Examples XML Diagram]"/>
        </div>

        <p>
              The purpose of the <tt>terminalInterface</tt> element is to show the user the command used on the terminal interface command line to execute the example.
              The <tt>terminalInterface</tt> element contains two elements:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>commandLine:</b> The actual command to recreate the example</li>
          <li><b>description:</b> a long description or explanation of the command line, which may contain HTML</li>
        </ul>
