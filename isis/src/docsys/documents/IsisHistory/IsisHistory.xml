	Integrated System for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS) has been a staple
	for the cartographic and scientific analysis of planetary image data 
	since 1992 with a heritage reaching back to 1971. The key strength of 
	ISIS is its ability to rigorously "control" planetary image data, 
	calculating the proper location and orientation of the observer and the 
	target. It is developed and maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey 
	using funds from the NASA Planetary Geology and Geophysics Cartography 
	Program and various U.S. and international missions. ISIS forms the 
	backbone for some ground data systems that process raw spacecraft data 
	into products suitable for archiving in the NASA Planetary Data System 
	(PDS).  For example, processing the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera 
	(LROC) and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) HiRISE images rely on 
	ISIS.

	The software has evolved numerous times to keep up with advances in 
	computing technology. The following outlines the progression of the 
	software since its inception:

	In 1971, Astrogeology's involvement in the Apollo program ended, and 
	many personnel in computer/cartographic related positions
	transferred to Earth Resources Observation and 
	Science (EROS) Center, to other federal agencies, or took jobs in the 
	private sector. James Crawforth (also known as Jim) and Alex Acosta 
	remained and established 
	a computer division to serve the Flagstaff Field Center. Development 
	of the unnamed image processing software package began on a Digital 
	Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-11/20 minicomputer with 8 K bytes of 
	memory, two 2.5 megabyte removable disks, an 800 bpi tape drive, a card 
	reader, and a teletype terminal. The PDP-11/20 ran a single user DOS/Batch 
	operating system that executed programs which were read from keypunch 
	cards.  The images were printed on film transparencies with an 
	$80,000 Optronics International Inc. filmwriter, and then viewed by 
	the analyst.

	In the late 1970s, the unnamed USGS image processing software was 
	migrated to a DEC PDP-11/45 minicomputer with 256 KB of memory and 
	larger 40 MB disks the size of washing machines, and ran the RSX-11M 
	operating system. This migration allowed a host of advances such as 
	(a) multiple users having access to the computer through VT52 black 
	and white video terminals, (b) programmers could develop applications 
	using as much as 32 KB of memory, and (c) a new method to view 
	images: on a screen using a DeAnza 512x512 Frame Buffer display 
	system! This configuration became known as the Flagstaff Image 
	Processing System (FIPS).

	In the early 1980s, DEC introduced their new VAX/VMS computers which 
	allowed for virtual addressing. Developers no longer had restrictions 
	on the size of the programs they developed. This major change in the
	computing environment allowed the Astrogeology programming team, led 
	by Eric Eliason, to convert the software from FIPS to the Planetary 
	Image Cartography System (PICS). The Transportable Application Executive 
	(TAE) was chosen as the user interface, and the programs migrated to run 
	on the VAX/VMS computers. The PICS software package was a popular tool 
	in the planetary science community because of its ability to process 
	Viking Orbiter, Voyager, Magellan, Landsat, and various other spacecraft 
	imagery.

        <h2><a name="IsisSoftware">Integrated System for Imagers and Spectrometers</a></h2>
        <p>
	In the late 1980s, the requirement to handle large volumes of complex 
	data acquired by new instruments significantly changed the requirements 
	on Astrogeology's imaging processing software. PICS could only handle 
	images with 7 or fewer bands, and left the user to manage each band as 
	a separate file. The Galileo mission's Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer 
	(NIMS) instrument, a hyperspectral imager capable of collecting images 
	with up to 408 bands, was the first to show the limitation of the PICS 
	software. To efficiently handle many bands for 
	a single image, the PICS software package had to be fundamentally 
	redesigned. The new package, the Integrated System for Imaging 
	Spectrometers (ISIS) came into existence under the guidance of the 
	designer Jim Torson and developer Kris Becker. After passing through 
	an internal version 1.0 prototype, this software was released as 
	ISIS 2.0. 
        </p>
        <p>
	In the early 1990s, the Clementine mission collected hundreds of 
	thousands of images with the Ultraviolet/Visible (UVVIS) and Near-Infrared 
	(NIR) cameras. The hardware and software requirement to process the 
	large volume of data led to a transition to new hardware and the use of 
	the Oracle data base system to streamline the processing methods. Perl 
	scripts were used to run repetitive tasks and also introduced at this 
	time. These innovations were largely incompatible with PICS.

	Cost also drove the change from PICS to ISIS. PICS operated on the aging 
	and expensive VAX/VMS computer system. The planetary community often 
	lamented the $50,000 price tag for a single machine with a display 
	device. At this time, UNIX began to make a push in the computing 
	world. Astrogeology's computer group decided to merge the PICS and 
	ISIS software and move to the SunOS and DEC OSF1 platforms under 
	the UNIX operating system. The integration of PICS and ISIS was led 
	by Kay Edwards, leading to the creation of ISIS 2.1. 
        </p>
        <p>
	During the late 1990s, ISIS continued to grow in both number of 
	applications and the supported operating systems. Software to process 
	data from Galileo Solid State Imager, Imager for Mars Pathfinder, Mars 
	Global Surveyor Mars Orbiter Camera, Mars Odyssey THEMIS, and other 
	instruments were added. The software was ported to the Linux operating 
	system as the demand for cheaper computers with "Open-source software" 
	increased. The ISIS 2.1 display software allowed for visual image 
	analysis directly on the user's desktop instead of requiring 
	specialized monitors. ISIS made huge gains in usage by non-USGS 
	customers, especially with the increased focus on cartographic 
	processing. With the popularity of the ISIS software package, the 
	meaning of the acronym "ISIS" was changed to Integrated System for 
	Imagers and Spectrometers. 
        </p>
        <p>
 	
	By 2001, Astrogeology recognized that the cost and time to maintain 
	the ISIS software package was becoming more difficult as different 
	components of the software system became obsolete or became harder 
	to manage. Users constantly asked for TAE to be replaced by a 
	standard Graphical User Interface (GUI). The ISIS development staff 
	could not use some of the powerful debugging tools that were 
	available, because they did not function well on computer code 
	written in Fortran or C. Many of the Open-source Application
	Program Interfaces (APIs) were only 
	available in C++ or Java, and thus not available for usage in ISIS. 
	The cube file formats did not efficiently support missions that 
	acquired data with line scan cameras. In order to take advantage 
	of new capabilities in the computer technology, the decision was 
	made to modernize ISIS. Jeff Anderson led the effort to convert 
	the ISIS programs written in Fortran/C to C++, creating ISIS 3.

	A second driver for the creation of ISIS 3 was a new wave of 
	instruments that produced gargantuan images.  For example, the 
	Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter HiRISE camera routinely acquires 1000 
	Megapixel images.  Even more challenging was the need to produce 
	controlled mosaics consisting of thousands of large images from the Lunar 
	Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera Narrow Angle Camera (NAC).  Solving 
	for the position and orientation of the spacecraft required handling 
	complex manipulations of extremely large matrices.  Even the 
	efficient access of ancillary data, historically stored as text in 
	file headers, became an issue.  ISIS 3 underwent a series of major 
	updates to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the map projected 
	output from the software.

      Today, ISIS 3 continues to evolve to meet the needs of users within and 
      outside the Astrogeology Science Center.  It remains the premier software 
      package for putting pixels in the correct location in digital space.  Releases 
      of new versions occur about 4 times a year, with major releases every year 
      or two.  Experience suggests that this pace strikes the right balance 
      between stability and timely improvements to ISIS 3.  It should be noted 
      that the data ISIS uses (e.g., SPICE) are frequently updated and small 
      patches are sometimes put out in between the scheduled releases.
