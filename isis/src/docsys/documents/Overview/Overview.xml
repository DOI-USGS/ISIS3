        <p>
	  The Integrated System for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS) is a free, 
	  specialized, digital image processing software package developed by 
	  the USGS for NASA.  ISIS key feature is the ability to place many 
	  types of data in the correct cartographic location, enabling disparate 
	  data to be co-analyzed.  ISIS also includes standard image processing 
	  applications such as contrast, stretch, image algebra, filters, and 
	  statistical analysis. ISIS can process two-dimensional images as well 
	  as three-dimensional cubes derived from imaging spectrometers. The 
	  production of USGS topographic maps of extraterrestrial landing sites 
	  relies on ISIS software. ISIS is able to process data from NASA and 
	  International spacecraft missions including Lunar Orbiter, Apollo, 
	  Voyager, Mariner 10, Viking, Galileo, Magellan, Clementine, Mars 
	  Global Surveyor, Cassini, Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, 
	  MESSENGER, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, Chandrayaan, Dawn, and Kaguya.

        <p>
          The ISIS software is a valuable resource for planetary missions that 
	  require systematic data processing, products for planning, and research 
	  and analysis of derived data products.  By using ISIS, missions can 
	  leverage millions of dollars of software development that NASA has paid 
	  for.  However, before the power of ISIS can be applied to an instrument, 
	  a camera model and custom programs to ingest mission-specific ancillary 
	  data are necessary.  Once an instrument is added to ISIS, it can support 
	  data processing pipelines, radiometric calibration, photometric 
	  calibration, band-to-band registration of multispectral data, 
	  ortho-rectification, construction of scientifically accurate and 
	  cosmetically pleasing mosaics, generation of control networks solutions 
	  and creation of topographic models.
