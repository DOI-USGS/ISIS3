        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
        This document is a reference to the various objects and groups, which can be found in ISIS labels.
        The definition of each object/group, the parameter meanings, and an example will be given.
        </p>

        <h2>
        IsisCube Object
        </h2>

        <p>
        The IsisCube Object is simply a container.  It is used to house the various elements (groups and objects) that make up an ISIS cube.  The IsisCube object is comprised of the Core object, which defines the cube size and pixel attributes and many optional groups that are described elsewhere in this document including Archive, BandBin, Instrument, Kernels, and Mapping Groups.  While we present a whole IsisCube object we will save of the individual elements in their own sections.

        <h3>Core Object</h3>
        <p>
        The core object is used to house the groups (Dimensions and Pixels) that describe the size and pixel attributes of the cube, as well as the storage type of the data.

Tile indicates the pixels are stored in tiles which is the preferred storage mechanism in  as it facilities the fastest “universal access”. The tiles are stored in row major format.  That is, all the tiles for band 1 ordered from left-to-right, then top-to-bottom, followed by all the tiles for band 2, etc.</td>

          </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>Dimensions Group</h3>
        <p>
        This group contains keywords which define the physical dimensions of the cube.  The group is always found inside the Core object.

        <h3>Pixel Group</h3>
        <p>
        This group describes information about the pixels in a cube.  The group is always found inside the Core object.
        </p>

      <td>Currently there are three type of pixels in ISIS which represent unsigned 8-bit vaues (0 to 255), signed 16-bit values (-32768 to 32767) and 32-bit IEEE floating point pixel values.  [Future option] Support alternative pixel types.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>ByteOrder</td>
      <td>String (Lsb, Msb)</td>

  </tr>
  <tr><td>Base, Multiplier</td>
      <td>Double</td>
      <td>These values are used to scale UnsignedByte and SignedWord pixels so they appear to be Real (32-bit floating) pixels.  That is, realDn = diskDN * Multiplier + Base.  These values are always 0.0 and 1.0 when Type=Real.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

        <h2>AlphaCube Group</h2>
        <p>
        This group is used to map pixel locations in a child cube (beta) back to its parent cube (alpha).  It is necessary in order to determine which detector a pixel represents in ISIS camera models.  The group is created by ISIS ingestion programs (e.g., thm2isis, moc2isis, ciss2isis, etc) and automatically updated by programs such as crop, pad, reduce, or enlarge.  The keywords found in this group can occur in one of two places.  Either inside of the AlphaCube group or inside of the Instrument group and therefore they can occur twice.  Once if a crop occurred in Instrument (level 1) space and again if a crop occurred in Mapping (level 2) space.
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:4em;">
Group = AlphaCube
    AlphaSamples          = 320

  </tr>
</table>
        <h2>Archive Group</h2>
        <p>
        This group is used to store keywords that identify archival information.  That is, information which uniquely identifies the data.  There is not a “required” set of keywords for this group.  Generally, the keywords found in this group represent PDS specific information as indicated in the example given below.
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:4em;">

  ImageKeyId          = "5618102401"
  RationalDescription = “OLYMPUS MONS SPECIAL RED WA"
EndGroup
</pre>

        <h2>BandBin Group</h2>
        <p>
        This group is used to stored information regarding each band in the cube.  This implies that every keyword in the group be an array with a dimension equal to the number of bands in the cube.  This group is not required nor if it exists are any particular keywords required.  That is, the names of keywords are irrelevant although some instrument- specific programs may expect certain keywords to be available (e.g., OriginalBand).  The keywords in this group will be automatically pruned if any program uses the input cube attribute option (e.g., from=input.cub+1,3-4).
        </p>

<pre style="padding-left:4em;">
Group = BandBin
  OriginalBand = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  Center       = (6.78, 6.78, 7.93, 8.56, 9.35) &lt;microns&gt;
  Width        = (1.01, 1.01, 1.09, 1.16, 1.20) &lt;microns&gt;
  FilterNumber = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
EndGroup
</pre>

<table class="tableFormattedInformation" align="center">
  <tr><th>Keyword</th>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>  OriginalBand</td>
      <td>  Integer</td>
      <td>  This keyword indicates the original band number at the current band location.  Hence, extracting bands 2 and 5 from a cube via the input cube attribute option would yield OriginalBand = (2,5)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>  Center, Width</td>
      <td>  Double</td>
      <td>  Often these keywords are used to describe the center wavelength and width of each band.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

        <h2>ImportLabel Object</h2>
        This object contains the original labels that were read during the import process, if possible.  For example, vicar2isis and pds2isis often have many more labels than are required by ISIS programs.  However, there may be information in those labels that the user would like to examine or preserve.  Note that ISIS program should never use any keywords values in these labels.

EndObject
</pre>

        <h2>Instrument Group</h2>
        <p>
        This group stores specific information regarding the mission and instrument.  This information is typically used to perform radiometric calibration as well as in camera models in order to accurately compute ground positions in a raw camera cube.  Obviously, the keywords in the group will vary from instrument to instrument.  However, there are three required keywords (Name, SpaceCraft, and Target).  Definitions for Instrument specific keywords can be found in the appropriate documentation for that instrument.

        <h2>Kernels Group</h2>
        <p>
        The Kernels group is created when the program “spiceinit” is run on a raw camera cube (e.g., Moc or Themis raw geometry).  The program determines which NAIF SPICE kernels are needed for proper operation of the camera model.  These kernels are written to this group.
