            does collect information that has the potential to identify a particular user.
            Some of the information users put in their profiles can be accessed by other users of this
            system, such as IM user names, location, website, occupation, and interests.

            <strong>Required Information:</strong>
            The only obligatory information required to use the Isis Support Center are Username, E-mail Address, and Password.
            E-mail address <em><strong>must</strong></em> be a valid e-mail address. Users concerned about privacy
            should use a username and e-mail account that does not identify them personally and should turn off the
            "Always show my e-mail address" in their profiles (this option is turned off by default).
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>E-mail Communcations Between Users:</strong>
            A user cannot e-mail a second user unless the second users has chosen "Always show my e-mail address" in his profile.
            If he chooses to turn this option on, users will be able to send mail to him through the Support Center,
            but they will not be able to see his e-mail address on the Support Center web pages. However, when a
            user e-mails another user through the Center, the e-mail address of the sender will be revealed to the recipient
            in the e-mail. If the sender requests a copy, the recipient's address will not be revealed in the copy. Site
            administrators do have access to user e-mail addresses.
