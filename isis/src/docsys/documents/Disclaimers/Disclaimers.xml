        <h2>Privacy Notice</h2>
        <h3>ISIS Web Site</h3>
        <p>
        Visits to this site are logged by domain. Personal
        identifying information, such as e-mail addresses, is
        not logged. Information, web traffic logs, e-mails,
        and other correspondence related to this web server and
        its content are archived. This information is used only by
        the USGS Astrogeology Web team members and others in the
        USGS hierarchy, and will not be released to any other
        program, organization, business, or individual.
        </p>

        <h3>ISIS Support Center</h3>
        <p>
            In addition to the general privacy policy for the ISIS Web Site, mentioned above,
            the
            <a href="https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3">ISIS Support Center</a>
            does collect information that has the potential to identify a particular user.
            Some of the information users put in their profiles can be accessed by other users of this
            system, such as IM user names, location, website, occupation, and interests.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Required Information:</strong>
            The only obligatory information required to use the ISIS Support Center are Username, E-mail Address, and Password.
            E-mail address <em><strong>must</strong></em> be a valid e-mail address. Users concerned about privacy
            should use a username and e-mail account that does not identify them personally and should turn off the
            "Always show my e-mail address" in their profiles (this option is turned off by default).
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>E-mail Communications Between Users:</strong>
            A user cannot e-mail a second user unless the second users has chosen "Always show my e-mail address" in his profile.
            If he chooses to turn this option on, users will be able to send mail to him through the Support Center,
            but they will not be able to see his e-mail address on the Support Center web pages. However, when a
            user e-mails another user through the Center, the e-mail address of the sender will be revealed to the recipient
            in the e-mail. If the sender requests a copy, the recipient's address will not be revealed in the copy. Site
            administrators do have access to user e-mail addresses.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Visibility of Topics, Instant Messages, and Other Communications</strong>
            Messages posted to the forum are publicly viewable. Other forms of correspondence (private messages, e-mail, and postings
            to the old ISIS Support Center/Support Wizard) may be published on the forum, but all identifying information will be
            removed or permission will be requested from the user to include the message on the board.
