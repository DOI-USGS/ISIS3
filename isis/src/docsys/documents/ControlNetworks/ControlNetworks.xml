	  <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <h3>Control Network</h3>
        <p>A Control Network in ISIS is a structure which holds a network of image correspondances, also known as tie points or control points, which identify common ground points across multiple images of the same body. A Control Network is made up of Control Points (the common tie point) and a Control Point has one or more Control Measures (measurements in image space of the common point in a particular image). There are two file formats for Control Networks in ISIS -- a binary google protocol buffer format and a human-readable pvl format. Both contain the same contents and information. This document describes the keywords present in the PVL format for convenience.</p>

	<h2>Control Network</h2>
        <p>This section describes the keywords associated with the main Control Network object.</p>

<!--When this information is presented to the person running an application, it should be displayed in appropriate units.

If any a priori coordinate is present without a corresponding a priori sigma, it will be ignored by bundle adjustment applications, and the a priori information for that coordinate will be recomputed during the bundle adjustment.  Any a priori coordinate with a valid value and a valid corresponding sigma, will be used as the a priori coordinate value in the bundle adjustment as is and not recomputed.  For example, a tie point can have a valid AprioriiZ value entered and a valid AprioriSigmaZ without either the X or Y coordinates set.  The bundle adjustment will compute AprioriX and AprioriY values, and their corresponding sigmas, but use the AprioriZ and AprioriSigmaZ from the control net.   Additionally the use of the a priori values in a bundle adjustment is determined by the presence of the constraint flags (LatitudeConstrained, LongitudeConstrained, RadiusConstrained, XConstrained, YConstrained, and ZConstrained). If the constraint flag is true for a particular a priori values the constraint will be applied during a bundle adjustment, however if the constraint flag is false, the constraint will not be used in the bundle adjustment. This allows individual a priori sigma values to be turned off and on without loosing the values.

       <td>Standard deviation of line measurement. An indicator of precision used in the weighting of measurements in the bundle adjustment (i.e. Jigsaw). May be determined from experience (e.g., manual point measurement) or perhaps estimated within an automated point measurement technique (e.g., ellipse fitting of crater edges, or through the use of an interest operator). Units are pixels.

      <td>  None</td>
      <td>
The difference between the 'estimated' sample measurement (as determined at the end of each iteration of the bundle adjustment) and the original sample measurement. Used in the determination of outliers throughout the bundle. Measurement residuals are used upon convergence to compute the reference variance (σ<SUB>0</SUB><SUP>2</SUP>) which in turn is used to scale the inverse of the normal equations matrix for error propagation. Units are pixels.

''''''Note:'''''' The computation of this value by ISIS automated point measurement methods is yet to be determined. Eventually this should be defined before jigsaw runs such as pointreg setting it based on how well the measurement coregistered.

'''AI''' Can Ken E. look at autoreg output stats to determine an accurate sigma from those stats.
