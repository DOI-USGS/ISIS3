  <p>
    Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS) is free and
    open-source software (FOSS) developed by the USGS Astrogeology
    Science Center for NASA and the planetary community. ISIS is a
    fundamental tool for processing raw archival data into analysis ready
    products and includes standard image processing tools such as
    contrast, stretch, image algebra, filters, and statistical analysis.
    However, ISIS's key feature is the ability to place different types of
    data in the correct cartographic locations on extraterrestrial bodies.
    The cartographically located data can then be used to create archives,
    topographic or cartographic maps, digital elevation models, and other
    scientific products.

  <p>
    ISIS is a valuable resource for planetary missions that require
    systematic data processing, products for planning, and research and
    analysis of derived data products. Support for a mission is added to
    ISIS by creating sensor models, tools for ingesting mission-specific
    ancillary data, and optional tools for calibrating mission data. Once
    a mission is supported, data from that mission can be used with the
    full suite of processing and analysis tools in ISIS. ISIS supports
    data from NASA and International spacecraft missions including Lunar
    Orbiter, Apollo, Voyager, Mariner 10, Viking, Galileo, Magellan,
    Clementine, Mars Global Surveyor, Cassini, Mars Odyssey, Mars
    Reconnaissance Orbiter, MESSENGER, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter,
    Chandrayaan, Dawn, Kaguya, and New Horizons.
