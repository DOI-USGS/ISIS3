           * the mission mapped the amount and distribution of chemical elements and minerals
           * that make up the martian surface. The spacecraft globally mapped many elements,
           * and the maps of hydrogen distribution led scientists to discover vast amounts of
           * water ice in the polar regions burried just beneath the surface. Odyssey recorded
           * the radiation environment in low Mars orbit to determine the radiation-related risk
           * to any future human explorers who may one day go to Mars. All of these objectives
           * support the four science goals of the Mars Exploration Program.

     * The %Isis 3 Developers' (API) and Programmers' References are provided on this
     * site for developers to access information about the %Isis Objects that are the
     * building blocks of the %Isis software package. %Isis 3 is written in the C++
     * programming language. %Isis 3 Objects are in $ISISROOT/src/[module]/objs,
     * where [module] is a subdirectory containing related Objects.
     *
     * The Developers' Reference, also called the Application Program Interface (API),
     * is designed for %Isis application developers. Only information of use and interest
     * to an application developer is provided, such as public and protected class members,
     * deprecated items, known bugs, etc.
     *
     * The Programmers' Reference is designed primarily for our in-house %Isis programming team who
     * develop and maintain %Isis Objects. Information provided in the Programmers' Reference includes
     * internal documentation, to-do lists, private members, etc.
     *
     * Currently, Object documentation is under development as we move to a new documentation system
     * and old documentation is converted to the new system, content is reviewed and updated, and
     * new documentation is completed. The References will be updated frequently on the
     * <a href="http://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov" target="_top">%Isis 3 website</a> - access them via the
     * %Isis 3 Technical Docs link on the home page.
