   * @brief Reads user preferences from a data file.
   *
   * This class is used to load, set, and obtain user preferences for
   * the operation of Isis. User preferences for Isis are items such
   * as the name of the log file, default data directories, and processing
   * status. This is essentially a specialized version of a Label object. It
   * reads a system-wide preference file and overwrites values in
   * the label with a user preference file. This object does not need
   * to be modified to add new prefences ... simply edit the system
   * wide preference file, add the new group and keywords, update the
   * preference document (user documentation) explaining the new
   * keywords.

   *   @todo The Preference class needs private methods & variables documented.
   *   The documentation shows methods that don't exist in the code. It also
   *   needs an example.
   *   @history 2003-04-23 Jeff Anderson - reworked the class to use the Label
   *                           object.
   *   @history 2003-05-16 Stuart Sides - Modified schema from astrogeoloy...
   *                           isis.astrogeology
   *   @history 2003-12-03 Stuart Sides - added HasGroup member.
   *   @history 2005-10-03 Elizabeth Miller - changed @ingroup tag
   *   @history 2008-01-09 Steven Lambright - Made Application a friend
   *                           for destruction purposes
   *   @history 2008-07-08 Steven Lambright - Now uses atexit for destruction
   *   @history 2010-05-28 Steven Lambright - More resilient to $HOME/.Isis
   *                           problems
   *   @history 2010-07-19 Jeannie Walldren - Added FileCustomization group to
   *                           TestPreferences file
   *   @history 2012-02-24 Steven Lambright - This class now sets the thread
   *                           limit in the Qt global thread pool.
   *   @history 2013-03-27 Jeannie Backer - Added Near mission to DataDirectory
   *                           group to TestPreferences file. References #1248.
   *   @history 2015-05-27 Andrew Stebenne - Backwards Compatibility Issue:
   *                           Preference now throws an exception when Preference.Load()
   *                           is called on a nonexistent preference file. This may cause issues
   *                           for anyone who has been using a nonexistent preference file.
