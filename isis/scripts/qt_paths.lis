#  Qt Frameworks need relative path loading of all libraries they  reference.
#  They all will exist in $ISISROOT/3rdpaty/lib.  The @loader_path is where
#  the current library exists in the framework which is assumed to be
#  $ISISROOT/3rdparty/lib/qt*.framework/Versions/4/.  The path to all libraries
#  are therefore fixed and the same path for all.
