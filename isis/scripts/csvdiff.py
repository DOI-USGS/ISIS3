"""
Compares two comma-separated-value files cell by cell, optionally using a
tolerance file for numeric types.  The tolerance file must contain one
tolerance per line of the form:

  COLUMN=VALUE

where COLUMN is the name of the tolerance value for every cell in that column,
and VALUE is the actual tolerance that will be compared against the difference
between the values in the two files.

Usage:

  csvdiff.py CSV1 CSV2 [TOLERANCES]

Output will be a message stating either SUCCESS or FAILURE followed by an
explanation of why.  Difference failures will also include a reference to the
exact line and column where the offending difference occurred.  The program
will terminate with an error signal when a failure occurs during processing.

Before any cells are compared the program will first ensure that the two CSV
files to be compared have the same number of columns and rows, additionally
checking that their headers match.

Future versions will support an option for submitting files without headers.
