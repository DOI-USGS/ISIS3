  # Seeds the polygon with Control Points by creating a grid, the centermost
  # grid is placed in the center of the polygon. Then, 2 points within each
  # grid is checked for overlap. One of these points lies 1/6th of the grid
  # dimension up and left from the grid's center point, while the other checked
  # point lies 1/6th of the grid dimension down and right from the grid's center
  # point. If these new points contain overlap, then they are seeded with a
  # Control Point.The following XSpacing/YSpacing parameters denote the dimensions
  # of the grid.
  # Strip is best used on polygons whos overlaps results in strips of data,
  # such as polygons from line scan cameras.

  # the polygon is a 4:1 rectangle, and so forth.
