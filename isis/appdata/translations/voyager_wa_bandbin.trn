# This ISIS translation file is used to create ISIS band bin cube labels
# from Voyager ".IMG" labels for the WA camera. Other sections of the ISIS
# labels are handled by other translation files.

# This translation contains the known filter names for the WA
# camera. It translates them one for one. The (*,*) would have worked, but
# they are listed for documentation purposes. Note the filter name does not
# correspond directly to the filter number unless the camera is known (NA, WA).
# Note: NAD is not listed in some references instead SODIUM is listed.
