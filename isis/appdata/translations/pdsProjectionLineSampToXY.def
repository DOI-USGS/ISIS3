# This file is used by the ProcessImportPds class to define the offset and
# multiplication factors used to convert PDS 3 SampleProjectionOffset
# and LineProjectionOffset to ISIS UpperLeftX and UpperLeftY.
#
# The Keyword defines which keyword is searched for in the pds file.  The
# Pattern is then used to match the value in the defined keyword.  If there
# is a match,  the given values are used.
# The defaults used in ProcessImportPds are:
#      xMult  =  -1.0
#      yMult  =   1.0
#      xOff   =  0.5
#      yOff   =  0.5
#
# Equations used are
#
#     upperLeftX = xmult * (sampleOffset + xOff) * PixelResolution
#     upperLeftY = ymult * (lineOffset + yOff) * PixelResolution
#
#  Anytime a new group is added to this file, all 6 keywords must to be
#  defined (Keyword, Pattern, xMult, yMult, xOff, yOff).

#  @history 2007-04-10  Tracie Sucharski, Original version with
#                       Isis2 definitions.
#  @history 2008-06-10  Jeff Anderson, Fixed Magellan to be more specific to
#                       FMAPS and MIDRS
#  @history 2008-10-01  Steven Lambright, Fixed Isis 2 offsets, fixed cassini radars
#                       Keyword/Pattern values. Commented and fixed MIDR offsets.
#  @history 2011-01-26  Janet Barrett, Added support for Kaguya Terrain Camera
#                       (TC_MAP)
#  @history 2011-11-16  Jeff Anderson, Added support for LROC data
#  @history 2012-03-04  Janet Barrett, Added support for Kaguya Terrain Camera
#                       Ortho data (TCO_MAP)
#  @history 2017-05-25  J Bonn  KAGUYA TERRAIN CAMERA and  KAGUYA TERRAIN CAMERA
#                       ORTHO entires to +0.5 yoff,yoff per ticket m04506
#  @history 2017-05-26  T Hare  With ticket m02244 fix, Removed entires that no
#                       longer need an override including: CHANDRAYAAN and LRO
#                       MINIRF, CASSINI RADAR, LROC PDS RDR, MESSENGER DEM, and
#                       HRSC PDS products. Added new entry for MGS MOLA

Object = ProjectionOffsetMults
  #  MAGELLAN - MIDR
  #  Must stay above ISIS2
  #  Magellan MIDR file labels were converted from VICAR labels to PDS
  #   labels, and in this conversion the sample/line offsets were rounded
  #   to whole numbers; subpixel accuracy was lost. Because of this, we'll
  #   never exactly match the latitude/longitude but we can be close.
