## Step-by-step Issue Reporting: [¶](#Step-by-step-Issue-Reporting-)

1.  Tell us if this is a Bug, a Feature Request, a Question, a
    Recommendation, a problem with Documentation, or a Crash that is
    stopping your work.

    including the program name (e.g., "destripe is missing reset icon in
    the toolbar").
3.  When describing your issue, provide a clear description of the
    issue. We need as much information as possible to help us identify
    and fix the problem. Too much information is better than not enough.
    Feel free to use the markdown tools to better illustrate the issue.
    This is especially useful when quoting error messages or
    documentation.
4.  Consider including these in your description:
      - All the steps necessary to reproduce the problem
      - Command line with the exact arguments you used
      - Spacecraft and instrument names of the input files
      - Is the issue consistently reproducible?
      - Your operating system or distribution name and version
      - The exact error message. If possible, copy-paste the error
        messages into the issue description.
5.  Select the priority you feel this issues needs
6.  Select the appropriate Category. Usually you'll only want to use
    Applications and Installation. Developers may need to report an API
    or Infrastructure issue.
7.  Include the ISIS software version you are working with
8.  Keep a close watch on your email for changes in the issue status and
    for notes being added. If the support team needs additional
