# Summary
Include a brief summary of the RFC so readers can determine if the RFC is of interest.

# Motivation
Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# Proposed Solution / Explanation
Explain the proposal as if it were already included in the code base or in place. This may mean:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining changes in terms of example usage.
- Explaining how developers or consumers might think about a new feature. Conceptually what is changing?
- If applicable, what might sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or migration guidance look like?
- If applicable, how might this alter current workflows or processes?
- If applicable, a more technical portion that describes:
  - how the feature might interact with other features
  - what the system architecture might look like
  - how testing might be done
  - what corner cases could exist that are not covered
  - this section should link back to the examples provided above

# Drawbacks
Why should we *not* do this?

# Alternatives
  - Why is this design or solution the best of all possible solutions?
  - What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
  - What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved Questions
  - What parts of the design will be merged through the RFC process prior to merging?
  - What parts of the RFC are expected to be addressed through implementation before stabilization?
  - What related issues are out of scope for this RFC, but could be addressed in future RFCs?

# Future Possibilities
  - What future extensions could be made from this RFC?
  - What other ideas might you have? This is a great place to 'dump related ideas'.
