## [Unreleased]

### Changed

### Added

### Deprecated

### Fixed

## [7.1.0] - 2022-07-27

### Changed
- Updated the LRO photometry application Lronacpho, to use by default the current 2019 photometric model (LROC_Empirical). The model's coefficients are found in the PVL file that exists in the LRO data/mission/calibration directory. If the old parameter file is provided, the old algorithm(2014) will be used. This functionality is desired for calculation comparisons. Issue: [#4512](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4512), PR: [#4519](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/pull/4519)
- Updated the LRO calibration application Lrowaccal to add a units label to the RadiometricType keyword of the Radiometry group in the output cube label if the RadiometricType parameter is Radiance. No functionality is changed if the RadiometricType parameter is IOF. Lrowaccal has also been refactored to be callable for testing purposes. Issue: [#4939](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4939), PR: [#4940](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/pull/4940)
- Changed how logs are reported so they no longer only printing at the end of the applications execution. [#4914](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4914)
- Update marcical to include step 3 of the mission team's MARCI calibration process described [here](https://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/data/mro/mars_reconnaissance_orbiter/marci/mrom_1343/calib/marcical.txt). [#5004](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/pull/5004)
- Updated center / width values for TGO CaSSIS as requested [here](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/5006)

### Added
- Improved functionality of msi2isis and MsiCamera model to support new Eros dataset, including support for Gaskell's SUMSPICE files that adjust timing, pointing and spacecraft position ephemeris. [#4886](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4886)
- Added a new application, framestitch, for stitching even and odd push frame images back together prior to processing in other applications. [4924](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4924)
- Re-added and refactored the LRO photometry application lrowacphomap to be callable for testing purposes. Issue: [#4960](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4960), PR: [#4961](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/pull/4961)
- Added check to determine if poles were a valid projection point in ImagePolygon when generating footprint for a map projected image. [#4390](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4390)
- Added changes to lronaccal to use time-dependent dark files for dark correction and use of specific dark files for images with exp code of zero. Also added GTests for lronaccal and refactored code to make callable. Added 3 truth cubes to testing directory.  PR[#4520](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/pull/4520)
- Added failure for images with missing original label in caminfo. [#4817](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/pull/4817)

### Deprecated

### Fixed
- Added check to determine if poles were a valid projection point in ImagePolygon when generating footprint for a map projected image. [#4390](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4390)
- Fixed the Mars Express HRSC SRC camera and serial number to use the StartTime instead of the StartClockCount  [#4803](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4803)
- Fixed algorithm for applying rolling shutter jitter. Matches implementation in USGSCSM.
- Fixed isis2std incorrectly outputing signed 16 bit tiff files. [#4897](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4897)
- Fixed CNetCombinePt logging functionality such that only merged points are included in the log. [#4973](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4973)
- Removed SpkCenterId functions in Cassini camera models due to spkwriter writing positions of Cassini relative to Titan but labeling
it in the kernel as the position relative to the Saturn Barycenter. [#4942](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4942)
- Corrected issue where footprintinit would fail with a segmentation error. [4943](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4943)


## [7.0.0] - 2022-02-11

### Changed
- Disabled SURF algorithm for findfeatures, latest version of opencv no longer provides SURF as part of the base library [#3885](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/3885)
- Changed caminfo's parameter default values for MAXEMISSION and MAXINCIDENCE to be
synchronized with footprintinit default values of the same parameters.
This corrects inconsistencies of footprint generation failing in caminfo
but passing in footprintinit. [#4651](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4651).
- Changed the internal logic of ObliqueDataResolution() to use LocalEmission angle rather than Emission angle.
This will cause differences in output; new values will be more accurate because they use DEM rather than
ellipsoid. The cost to compute the local emissoin will increase by approximately x1.5. [#3600](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/3600)
- Changed website layout to better surface relevant documents.
[#4839](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/pull/4839)

[#4871](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/pull/4871)

### Added
- Added the USECAMSTATSTBL option to caminfo. This allows caminfo to extract existing
camera statistics from the CameraStatistics Table of the input cube instead
of recalculating CameraStatistics. Updated caminfo to output all CameraStatistics
Keywords when running CAMSTATS.  [#3605](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/3605).
- Added the ability to search filenames in measure's drop down boxes in Qnet Point Editor. [#4581](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4581)

- Added versioning to website documentation.
[#4852](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/pull/4852)
[#4872](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/pull/4872)

### Deprecated
- Deprecated edrget as discussed in [#3313](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/3313).

### Fixed

- Fixed qnet crashing when entering an invalid image name in the measure selection box. [#4581](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4581)
- Modified cnetcheck noLatLonCheck logic to correctly exclude ignored measures. [#4649](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4649)
- Fixed bug where the original label was not attached to stereo HRSC images on import [#4816](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4816)

## [6.0.0] - 2021-08-27

### Added
- Added a new application, isisimport. The application is designed to be a replacement for many of the mission/instrument specific import applications. It does not contain the templates for those applications at this time. It uses a templateing engine instead of the translation files.
- Added a new dark current correction to hical that works with the higher temperatures recent images are captured at. Use the new config file, $ISISDATA/mro/calibration/hical.0023_darkrate.conf, to enable the new dark current correction over the old dark current correction. Runs of hical without the new dark current correction will also produce an extra line in the output log indicating that the ZeroDarkRate module is disabled. [#4324](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4324)
- Added the ability to bundle adjust CSM models in jigsaw. Use the new CSMSOLVESET, CSMSOLVETYPE, and CSMSOLVELIST arguments to specify what you solve for. [#4537](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/pull/4537)

### Changed
- Added the ability to export footprint information from a CaSSIS ISIS Cube label to the generated output PDS4 label in tgocassisrdrgen. [#4473](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4473)
- isisVarInit.py no longer writes a "cat" statement by default to the activate scripts which cause the ISIS version information to be written on conda activate.  This can be included in those scripts via a command line option to isisVarInit.py.  Also, a quiet option is provided to isisVarInit.py to suppress its own writing to standard out, if needed.
- Changed how the images.csv file is output in jigsaw when there are multiple models. Now each sensor model will have its own images.csv file so that column headers can all be correct. For example, a solution involving LRONAC pairs and Apollo Metric images would generate three images.csv files: LRONAC Left, LRONAC Right, and Apollo Metric. [#4324](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4324)
- Changed the API of many Bundle utility classes as part of CSM support in jigsaw. [#4324](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4324)

## [5.0.2] - 2021-07-30

### Fixed

- Fixed an Minimum|Maximum calculation error when comparing all equal data in the qview statstics tool. [#4433](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4414)
- Fixed ISIS docs for incorrect path and -WEBHELP issues [#4510](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4510)
- Fixed a bug where writing out updated positions for framing cameras in jigsaw caused an error. [#4545](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4545)
- Fixed a bug where comments on BLOB labels were not written out. [#4442](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4442)

## [5.0.1] - 2021-06-10

### Fixed
- Fixed an arccos evaluating a double close to either 1, -1 when calculating the ground azimuth in camera.cpp. [#4393](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4393)
- Fixed hist outputs to N/A when all DNs are special pixels. [#3709](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/3709)
- Fixed SolarLon to compute from Table if cube is spiceinited. [#3703](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/3703)
- Fixed GUI alignment to be top aligned rather than centered to make parameters less ambiguous. [#3710](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/3710)
- Fixed hideal2pds bug where parameterizing for 8-bit output create 18-bit output. [#4006](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4006)
- Fixed Thm2isis to properly use output attributes [#4213](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4213)
- Fixed caminfo uselabel SegFault. [#4401](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4401)

### Changed
- isisVarInit.py no longer writes a "cat" statement by default to the activate scripts which cause the ISIS version information to be written on conda activate.  This can be included in those scripts via a command line option to isisVarInit.py.  Also, a quiet option is provided to isisVarInit.py to suppress its own writing to standard out, if needed.
- Changed the name of topds4 to isisexport. The application is designed to be a replacement for many of the mission/instrument specific export applications. It uses a templateing engine instead of the translation files.


## [5.0.0] - 2021-04-01

### Added
- Added the ability to read MiMAP v3 images through mimap2isis from the Kaguya data set. [#2067](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/2067)
- The following calibration applications were updated to not require local mission-specific SPICE kernels when working with spiceinited cubes: amicacal, ctxcal, lrowaccal, moccal, mdiscal, hical, hicalbeta, vikcal, and gllssical. This makes it possible to first run spiceinit using the spice server and then run these calibration applications without ever needing to download mission-specific kernels. If spiceinit has not been run on the input cube, these apps will still require the kernels area to run. [#4303](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4303)
- Added the new csminit application and CSM Library loading to the IsisPreferences file. Together these allow users to get CSM state strings from ISD files. Once CSM camera model support is added, these will be used to setup a Cube to use a CSM camera model.
- Added a new application, topds4, which generates an output PDS4 XML label and a PDS4-compliant ISIS Cube from an input Cube, a PDS4 label template, and optionally additional input XML, PVL, or JSON data. The Inja templating engine is used to render the output PDS4 label from the label template. [#4246](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/pull/4246)
- Added the ability to use a Community Sensor Model (CSM) instead of an ISIS camera model. To use a CSM sensor model with a Cube run the csminit application on the Cube instead of spiceinit.

- Fixed relative paths not being properly converted to absolute paths in isisVarInit.py [4274](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4274)
- Fixed issue where serial numbers for Kaguya TC and MI image could not be generated. [4235](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4235)
- Fixed hardcoded file naming in the hijitter app dealing with output from pipeline. [#4372](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/pull/4372)
- Fixed "About Qview" to point to website documentation. [4333](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4333)

### Changed

- Updated the FileList object to handle files that do not contain a trailing new line character. [#4372](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/pull/4372)
- Refactored Blob class to be used by classes that serialize to a Cube instead of inherited from. Impacted classes are GisBlob, History, ImagePolygon, OriginalLabel, OriginalXmlLabel, StrethBlob, StringBlob, and Table. [#4082](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4082)
- Fixed hi2isis MRO:ADC_TIMING_SETTINGS label conversion issue [4290](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4290)
- Changed csv2table to identify headers with arrays and create table fields as arrays instead of single fields for each element [3676](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/3676)

## [4.4.0] - 2021-02-11

- Updated spiceinit so that a user can specify a shape model and use the spice web service without any errors. [#1986](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/1986)

### Fixed

- Fixed lrowaccal so required SPICE files are reported instead of continuing without them. [#4038](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4038)
- Fixed not being able to enable USECOORDLIST argument in mappt. [#4150](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4150)
- Fixed history entry not being added to a cube when running spiceinit with web=true. [4040](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4040)
- Updated wavelength and bandbin values in translation files for the TGO CaSSIS BandBin group. [4147](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4147)
- Fixed the JunoCam serialNumber translation using an old keyword. [4341](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/4341)
- Fixed map2map bug where small images would return all null image [#632](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/631)

## [4.3.0] - 2020-10-02

### Changed

 - Camera models now use the ALE library to interpolate states and orientations. Users will likely see very small changes in sensor ephemerides. These were tested and are within existing interpolation tolerances. [#2370](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/2370)
 - The isis3VarInit script is now just called isisVarInit and allows for more robust paths. [#3945](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/pull/3945)
