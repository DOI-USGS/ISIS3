SPICE Kernel Automated Updates

SPICE kernels are required for the use of most ISIS applications. ISIS provides SPICE kernels for each mission
in the ISISDATA area. For information on how to download the ISISDATA area, see: LINK. 

ISIS provides ongoing automated updates of SPICE kernels for some of its supported missions by checking to see if there are new mission kernels available, and if so, fetching them and distributing them via the ISISDATA area. These missions are listed
in the table below, alongside their ISIS and Mission update cadences (how often ISIS looks for and then distributes new
SPICE kernel updates if available, and how often the mission typically provides updated kernels, if known.) If the mission 
update cadence is unknown, please contact the mission for more information. 

Missions that are not listed in the table below are provided with a static set of SPICE kernels that are not automatically updated. If you would like to request that the kernels provided with ISIS for one of these missions be updated, please submit a ticket at  [new issue](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/new/choose).
